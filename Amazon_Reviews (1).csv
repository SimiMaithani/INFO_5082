0,Jean Metzger,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy,  This item doesn’t have a lot number or expiration date. My face has broken out ever since using this. I didn’t put two and two together until I got a new one from my dermotologist. See photo. The one that is from my dermotologist has a lot # and expiration date.," November 17, 2017"
1,Epictetus,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware: Contains Octinoxate,"  I discovered too late that this contains Octinoxate, an established endocrine disruptor, rated 5 by EWG. It's also harmful to corals and implicated in coral bleaching, and sunscreens containing octinoxate are now banned in Hawaii. Extremely disappointing to find it in a respected brand. Stick with zinc oxide: there are lots of great alternative bio and eco-friendly brands. From Campaign for Safe Cosmetics: ""Octinoxate, also called Octyl methoxycinnamate or (OMC), is a UV filter. It can be absorbed rapidly through skin. Octinoxate has been detected in human urine, blood and breast milk, which indicates that humans are systemically exposed to this compound. Octinoxate is an endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can disrupt thyroid function."""," August 24, 2020"
2,Jrodriguez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dark skin!  No cast!,  I’m very glad that I took a chance on the sunscreen! I was a bit skeptical due to the mixed reviews and there weren’t very many reviews that talked about whether there would be a white cast on dark skin. This product rubs on very smoothly and you can’t even feel that it’s there. My make up blends flawlessly with this underneath. This is the best sunscreen I’ve ever use on my face! It’s so thin and moisturizing. A little goes a long way so if you have a white cast you may have used too much.  I have deep brown skin and there is no cast left.," July 5, 2020"
3,Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen product for UVA/UVB and with amazing formula,"  La Roche Posay Anthelios has been my holy grail for years, but at some point, I wanted my sunscreen to have something else, so I switched to ELTA 46 SPF. Amazon is now an authorized retailer, so for those reviews saying there are counterfeit / fake products, it's not like that anymore! ELTA has some of the best ingredients in sunscreen you can imagine. Well, in any skincare product :)  If you are looking for a good sunscreen, with extra benefits, go for this one. One of the best things is the coverage and protection. In Europe/Asia, most sunscreens have high rates both for UVA and UVB, but in the US, the main standard is SPF for UVB (rays causing burning, primarily), but not so much for UVA (UVA rays account for up to 95% of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's, and penetrates more deeply in the skin being more associated with aging process). Well, ELTA is one of those strange products (in the good sense) offering high protection for both, it does not leave a white cast, and it has ammaaaazing ingredients: Niacinamide comes high in the formulation (5%, as much as the overpriced NIA-24), and it's an all time star ingredient (antioxidant, brightens skin tone, treats hyperpigmentation, increases collagen, anti-inflammatory., etc), plus vitamin e, hyaluronic acid. Seriously, this lotion is game-changer, and very affordable for how good the formula is!"," February 10, 2018"
4,RunnerDude,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon IS an authorized resller,"  To all the people worried about getting a knock off product: I contacted EltaMD directly and Amazon IS an authorized reseller. I would just make sure you're actually buying it from Amazon, not another party and Amazon is just shipping it.The product is pretty good, doesn't make my face greasy. Unfortunately it doesn't really have any moisturizing benefits so I have to use it with a moisturizer. Also has a faint scent, bot not as bad as other sunscreens."," March 29, 2018"
5,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Test this on a small area first!!,"  I bought this per my dermatologist’s recommendation to work as a sunscreen and moisturizer for my rosacea, and it made me break out horribly. I used it 1-2 times per day for a week or two and felt it might be making me break out, so stopped with the hope I could at least use it on vacation as a sunblock. When I did this, applying multiple times per day, I thought I had gotten sunburned, when in actuality my face was just red, swollen, and pimply from this lotion - it all subsided a day or two after I stopped using it. I switched to normal Coppertone and had no problems with burn or breakouts after that. I have never had a reaction to any product as severe as I did this one, which is odd considering it is supposedly designed for sensitive skin types, so beware!"," May 14, 2018"
6,John Galt,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Never Used Moisturizer Until I Discovered EltaMD.  WARNING!,"  I really like this SPF cream. First of all it doesn't smell 'perfumey' - it might have a hint of suntan lotion smell, but it's really faint. Second this cream is NOT GREASY and disappears fast - even though it has 9% zinc oxide. Third it has 46+ SPF with 7.5 Octinoxate to slow burning. I've finally had to admit that I need a strong SPF; given past brushes with melanoma and the sincere desire to not have the hide of an alligator. And while not inexpensive, this is far less than the cost of a lot of the better-quality moisturizers for men. You usually get exactly what you pay for and this is worth every penny. Finally, my better half tells me that this company doesn't test on animals. I believe that's a good thing. ;-)WARNING:  Many buyers have received fake products from other sellers.  Buy only when sold and shipped by Amazon!  The authentic product will have a flat sloping pump top that is shown in the attached photo.  The fake products have a rounded top.Pros:• Non greasy formula that easily absorbs into skin• Odorless and transparent• 9% Zinc Oxide provides long lasting protection• 7+% Octinoxate to reduce burning by dispersing UVB rays• Tested reliable 30+ SPF• UVA/UVB sun protectionCons:• More expensive than drug-store brands"," June 1, 2017"
7,DLC,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeowtch - itching, burning, then rash!","  I can't attest to the efficacy of the product, just posting to say, I had negative reactions to it. I have just crested the high side of mid-40s and really wanted to find a good daily sun protectant to guard against [further] aging. This was so well-reviewed, I chose it over the next closest contenders, Roche-Posay products (which I usually love).Unfortunately, the first week of using it, I began to get tiny bumps on my face (not visible to the naked eye, but easily perceived with fingertips when washing or applying moisturizer). I had also been using a new 'flavor' of body lotion, so I went back to my basic tried-and-true products to let everything calm down for a bit, and try to definitively eliminate the culprit.After two weeks, I again applied this on two successive days when I'd be out in the sun for an extended period. On Day 1, once I'd gotten outside and had started perspiring, my neck began burning, then itching maddeningly -- I was only outside in my yard gardening, so ran inside and I washed it thoroughly off my neck.  My face seemed okay, so I left it there, and applied the product again to my ears and face (no neck) on Day 2 when heading out for a long weekend walk.This time, again once I'd gotten outside and started perspiring, the product started burning and itching around my eyebrows and general eye area.  I washed it off as best I could at the next public water fountain.The next day, I began to show itchy, painful swollen patches on my face, ears, and throat (the latter pictured as best I could, but it was difficult to shoot an area I couldn't see!)  This time, there had been no other 'new to me' product used, nor was there anything else that I carefully applied to ears/face/throat, all areas that then became rashy....So alas, not a product I can use, and alas for the waste of a significant amount of money. >:/  I've used other physical sunscreens in the past (eg Badger) without any issues, so it must be some substance in the cream besides that causing the problem."," June 7, 2019"
8,Henshaw,1.0 out of 5 stars,Allergic reaction,  Used once. Caused reaction on face and  broke out in hives. (See picture) Im unsure what ingredient would have caused such a severe reaction. Discontinued use and swelling and hives went away within 24 hours. Be careful.," June 17, 2019"
9,Pen Name,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed Amazon Should Remove This Product,"  I agree Amazon should not sell this product. It should be removed from the list right away. I had melanoma several years ago. And bought this thinking I was making the best decision to protect my skin. I had an allergic reaction, I thought there was something wrong with my blood pressure. The next day my face was covered in welts. My fave still is itching and burning. DO NOT BUY THIS. Protect yourself and your skin."," March 26, 2019"
10,Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, but don't recommend buying online","  I LOVE this product for my rosacea prone skin. I recently tried to deviate to skinceutical spf, after using this for years, and broke out horribly. I ran to my closest derm to buy the EltaMD again.I did buy this ONCE on Amazon (quite a while ago) and I got something that did not look like the product. It was the same texture, but kind of yellowish. That bottle, like one of the previous posters showed, did not have an expiration stamp. The bottles usually do have an expiration stamp on the bottom.So, I still give it 5 stars for exceptional performance on sensitive skin and great sun protection, but recommend buying it in person, just to make sure you're getting the product you expect.I decided to reach out recently to ask EltaMD about buying online (I was having difficulty locating it locally). Here's what EltaMD recently told me about Amazon being an authorized seller, dated 9/10/19.""Thank you for contacting EltaMD.All EltaMD products listed on amazon.com after 5/8/17 through a recent business agreement are authorized.

11,SK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Deceiving with ingredients,"  I bought this and loved using it until I realized that it contained Octinoxate, which is a dangerous ingredient in skincare for women. This ingredient is NOT highlighted on the product information area on this site and only shows it on the bottle listed on the back. I will no longer be using this product, unfortunately. I wish more people knew about this dangerous ingredient, especially when it is in a product that we use on our skin DAILY for protection. Please change your product information so that this ingredient is mentioned! Please consider changing your formula so that it can be a better product."," September 17, 2020"
12,Gabby,3.0 out of 5 stars,why I am extremely satisfied: 1,"  I emailed EltaMD regarding the validity of the product, here is their response as of yesterday, 9/22/15I give it 3 stars because of my skepticism, but I love the product I have received, assuming it's legitimate."," March 24, 2015"
13,Remo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"UVA(which causes aging, wrinkle. . .) protection DOUBTFUL","  I use to love this product and have been using it religiously for the last 7 years. However recently I came across company based in Canada called The Sunscreen Company who claims to have sent the products out for third party testing and ELTA MD spf 46 performed poorly in UVA protection factor values. UVA rays are responsible for aging and wrinkles. Since I love the product and wanted to continue using it, I emailed ELTA MD for re-assurance but never got a response from them.Personally, I am inclined to trust the 3rd party findings because micronized zinc (like that used in EltaMD) inherently does not offer strong UVA protection, especially when included in such a low concentration (which is only one factor of the entire formulation process that contributes to final protection values). I’d love for EltaMD to perform testing and refute the data here, because I do want to go back to using their elegant formulas, but until then, I don’t have faith they offer good uva protection."," January 2, 2021"
14,Hoang Chi Truong. Author,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Go-to Morning and all-day sunscreen!,"  I've been using this product for two years and will not be without it for my morning routine. I carry one in my purse for driving (sun exposure) and reapply throughout the day if I leave the house or buildings. I'm nearly 60 y.o. and Asian. I used to have sun damaged age spots but since using this sunscreen, most faded and keeping my skin smooth.Be sure to reapply religiously every two hours and wear a wide brim hat. I also started to use it on the back of my hands to prevent more spots from forming.It's barely scented and pleasant. Easy to apply and not oily or sticky. It's easy to absorb and not chalky or leaving any unpleasant feel or reaction. My skin is not sensitive and has always been on a light to medium tone, depending on the seasons.I recommend it to women of my age. And by the way, drink a lot of water and wear a hat whenever possible. I also don't lay out in the sun to tan either. I think that helps."," April 6, 2021"
15,Eugene,1.0 out of 5 stars,why is your face so white??,"  it's difficult to give 1 star reviews but i felt like i had to write it just to get my opinion heard on this lotion.  for UV protection i would say it's like most face sunscreens out there, my face did not break out nor did it get red.  I have rosacea, oily skin, and very sensitive skin! (a killer combination i know).the big problem i have is that is leaves your face WHITE! I've tried to put a liberal amount and a small amount.  I tried using this only during the day, in combination with other lotions, after a toner.  But it's still unbelievable white.  Perhaps it would be better for light/fair skinned individuals, but i'm pretty tan so it looks like i put a layer of white out on my face.  The final straw was when my classmate told me, ""Why is your face so white??""  Pretty embarrassing, and having acne is embarrassing enough.Maybe this is more of a rant than a review, but if you like have your face looking like a ghost, by all means get this product.  But if you have a tan/darker skinned complexion, i would stay away."," June 17, 2017"
16,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,casket-ready finish,"  This is an excellent mineral sunscreen, but it WILL leave an obvious white cast on dark skin (I'm an NW44). There are some reviewers here who claim that it doesn't-- either they're not using the correct amount (1/4 teaspoon for the face) or they're lighter skinned than I am. Another thing is that it is quite drying and does leave a sheen on the skin once it has set-- this is easily corrected with a light dusting of powder (and it primes makeup beautifully) but you can't leave the house without it."," May 16, 2016"
17,Jenifer N. Wiand,1.0 out of 5 stars,I was sent fake product,"  I have used EltaMD Sunscreen for over 2 years. I love this product. I like how it goes on, doesn't feel sticky or greasy AND provides strong SPF protection. This product is regularly WHITE and a creamy consistency with no real odor. The last 2 orders of this product have been YELLOW, a different consistency and an altogether different product.Color, smell, consistency have all changed. I've researched to see if the product changed, but I haven't found anything. All I can surmise is that I was sold fake product.What I ordered is NOT what I received, and I won't be ordering fake product on here again. I'll go directly to the manufacturer's website.Sad. I now have 2 bottles that I'll never use due to subscribe and save order receipt timing. The REAL product is great, but that's not what I was sold the last 2 times. Packaging is correct. Product is fake!! BEWARE!!! No one likes paying for Medical grade skincare and not receiving it!"," October 3, 2021"
18,Betty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Oxybenzone is killing off the coral reefs. This formula contains Oxybenzone.,"  This product contains two ingredients we know to be killing the coral reefs. They're found in many sunscreens: Octinoxate, and Oxybenzone. This sunscreen contains the latter.  Even if you don't care about the environment (and why not? you do live here!) you probably aren't a fan of hurricanes, tropical storms, and the resulting floods. Coral reefs protect our shoes from erosion, mitigating the damage these storms, storms increasing in frequency and intensity. Please skip this sunscreen, and others containing the ingredients Octinoxate or Oxybenzone."," September 2, 2019"
19,Rich D.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Found the culprit,"  My skin is acne-prone and dehydrated thanks to Tazorac. After cutting out dairy, I finally figured out why Tazorac could not keep me completely clear... EltaMD UV Clear. What was supposed to help combat the side effects of Tazorac actually impeded its effects.EltaMD UV Clear causes clogged pores on my forehead and chin, and I typically get cystic acne on my chin because of it.I have decided to halt Tazorac and all actives for now to let my skin barrier heal while I try to find a sunscreen that will not break me out."," April 9, 2018"
20,Periwinkle,1.0 out of 5 stars,It.  Pills.  Always.,"  I’ve ordered and used this all-mineral spf product twice now.  The pros:  It does not sting my rosacea-prone skin, nor does it leave much of a white cast.  The cons:  It does leave my skin shiny and has a slight odor which I do not like (it fades quickly).  The worst issue is the pilling.  Not sometimes.  Always.  If I don’t rub it in just so and try to massage in a white streak, it pills.  If I touch my face or neck, it pills. If I try to gently dust some powder on to mitigate the shine, it pills.  The best sunscreen is one you like to use every day.  This is not it."," June 3, 2019"
21,WeeT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Expensive. No white cast, not gritty/tacky/greasy. Leaves skin moisturized.","  Update 5/28/18:I initially gave this product 5 stars because it truly is a great product. However I did have to update my review due to the amount of product for the price I paid. This bottle of sunscreen contains 1.7 oz of product. For sunscreen application on the face, it is recommended that you use at least half a teaspoon worth (just for your face alone, not your neck). That half a teaspoon is about 0.083 oz per application. So the bottle can last you 20 applications, not days, applications (since it's recommended you apply every 2 to 3 hours). To pay more than 30 bucks for less than a month's worth of usage seems to be really pricey.//Pleasantly surprised with this sunscreen. I live in Arizona and I know for a fact that I haven't been using as much sunscreen as I should have. The problem was that it was always so tacky, greasy, left a white cast, and irritated my skin. I've been using this sunscreen for at least a week now, and it wasn't irritating to my sensitive skin at all.  It applies easily. It's not watery but has a consistency of a thicker moisturizer. There's an initial cast as you are spreading the sunscreen evenly, but it goes away quite quickly. Sometimes I run into the issue with a gritty feeling left over after I apply sunscreen, I didn't have that issue with this one. It left my skin feeling plump and allowed me to apply my tinted moisturizer/make up after without any issues. I have oily/combo skin and this did not increase my sebum production at all, so that's definitely a plus.The recommended amount of sunscreen to apply to one's face is half a teaspoon (just the face), so this bottle is on the smaller size for what it costs.I had tried this sunscreen on the recommendation of a well-known influencer but had been debating between a more cost-effective (but seemingly just as good alternative). Missha's waterproof Sun Milk is a great contender with this sunscreen, for almost half the price! I'll see how the two compare."," May 21, 2018"
22,PelonPeloRico,1.0 out of 5 stars,Contains Octinoxate!!,"  This says it is a mineral sunscreen, but in fact it contains 7.5% Octinoxate. (See photo.) If you, like me, are trying to buy mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) to avoid chemicals that can be absorbed through your skin, then do not buy!(This product does feel amazing on your skin and doesn't leave a white residue...but that's because it's actually partially a chemical sunscreen, not a mineral one. There are plenty of chemical sunscreens that feel nice on your skin.)"," August 11, 2020"
23,deb,1.0 out of 5 stars,High hopes but unfortunately not for me,"  I can't bash this product completely because it may be very effective for someone else.  I've had a sensitivity to sunscreens for the last two years or so. The only brand that hasn't left me with blotchy, rashy skin is my Cera Ve with InvisibleZinc - but if you've used it before then you know that if you use a ""liberal"" amount... you still end up looking a bit dead or like a wanna-be clown.  I had high hope for this sunscreen.  ""UV Clear"" and ""Safe for sensitive skin and rosacea."" I received it in the morning, washed, moisturized, applied this sunscreen and went about my day.  By bedtime, I noticed a bit of blotchiness and a slight itch.  When I woke up in the morning my face was beet-red, slightly puffy, hot, burning/tingling and itchy as all hell.  I look and feel like I have a sunburn.SO - unfortunately not for me.  As I write this I'm contemplating putting an ice pack on my face...  UPDATE:  I did read more about one of Elta's active ingredients, Octinoxate and some of the adverse reactions are contact dermatitis, rash, dry skin, inflammation... blah blah blah...  My reaction was quite severe.  If you happen to have sensitive skin be careful.  I guess it's back to Cera Ve and the half-dead look for me (laughing)."," April 20, 2020"
24,Lauren,2.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,"  If you are debating on getting this, get the drmtlgy spf 45 instead!! Do your research first. This product bills and balls up so bad even with one simple moisturizer on underneath. Even without a moisturizer on, still balled up, so never mind re-applying. Can’t do anything with this sunscreen. I ordered the drmtlgy one instead and it doesn’t pill, almost identical ingredients, it’s cheaper and you get 2 oz of product. So yeah this is just all around not good I can’t believe the hype this product gets."," January 23, 2021"
25,Allison Hamm,2.0 out of 5 stars,"No breakouts, but I didn't like it","  After reading hundreds of reviews and trying several different ""sensitive"" face sunscreens, I bit the bullet and decided to try this although it's a little pricey. I'm the type who won't wear sunscreen if it feels as all greasy or heavy, even though I'm fair and know I need to. It just grosses me out. Most that I've tried -- Pür, Sun Bum, Aveeno Sensitive, Super Goop (the original cream formula) -- make me break out in little whiteheads. So I've been on a search for one that I would actually use for quite some time. Here's my take on this one:- It's fairly smooth and lightweight, and feels fine on my face. But it left my fingers sticky, and if I put it on parts of my body that I touch throughout the day (backs of hands, neck, shoulders, etc.), it leaves a tacky/sticky feeling. Hate it.- It rubs in well (so no white cast), and has not made me break out at all -- this is fairly impressive.- The finish is not matte, but gives my face that oily sheen that I hate. No, no, no.- Worst of all, it is not ""unscented."" I mean, it doesn't have an intentional scent, but it smells vaguely like... a hospital. It's not pleasant. The smell goes away after 20 minutes or so and I can endure, but it's pretty icky at first.So, I'll use the rest of the bottle because it was expensive and doesn't make my face break out and I'm trying to be a responsible adult and wear my sunscreen, but it's not for me -- will not be re-purchasing."," August 23, 2020"
26,speesea,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST sunscreen!,"  I have been wearing sunscreen on my face everyday for about 7 years now. I've tried a lot different sunscreens and hated pretty much everything I tried. It either left a white cast, burned my skin and eyes, pilled up immediately, or was horrible under makeup. This sunscreen is not only good - but I actually enjoy wearing it!I love almost everything about this sunscreen... my only complaint being it sometimes pills if I try to add anything on top of it. Other than that - the texture, the feel, the smell, I love. It is super rich and creamy to touch and feels very moisturizing when you apply to the face. It leaves a bit of shine but you can pat it out when it has dried. The container pumps the perfect amount each time - I use one pump for my face, neck, and ears.I also have VERY acne prone skin and this has not broken me out. I has almost no acne causing ingredients - the exception being Zinc Oxide and Butylene Glycol which are both only 1 (out of 10) on the acne causing scale [source cosdna]. It has actually improved the quality / texture since adding it to my routine.150% recommend"," April 7, 2019"
27,Kantu,1.0 out of 5 stars,White cast. Not for me.,"  It gives me a white cast. I’m not sure why exactly but I look like a ghost even after rubbing it in for a few minutes. Dermatologist says to use two lines worth, on the index and middle finger. Maybe people aren’t using that amount. But even when I use like half that, it still has a white powder look on my face. Just not as much.BUT, this is supposed to be good for darker skin. It’s better than the Aveeno one I tried, by far. So try it. Could just be me, because I’ve seen good reviews on this one from darker complexion people. I’m going to try the Olay one next. I tried first aid beauty, but I got the tinted one by recommendation, and that was a definite no for me. It just gets everywhere and separates the tint from the sunscreen so it’s not even.  And transfers to my hands and shirt if they touch my face or next, or arms. That was pretty bad for me.On to Olay in the red bottle(I have it saved but forgot the name)."," April 29, 2021"
28,Boodle,1.0 out of 5 stars,I Don't Understand!,"  I have purchased this sunscreen many times before.  I recently read the list of sunscreen ingredients to avoid and this one contains one: octinoxate.  So, for a while I tried some purely mineral sunscreens but they felt too heavy so I thought I would come back to this one because I love the weight and the texture--and read that the very small amounts of octinoxate contained in the sunscreen MAY not be problematic anyway.  With this last purchase, however, my skin broke out immediately, and worse than when I was a teenager (I'm 53). It was just awful.  I don't know if there's something wrong with this particular one but I've never had a problem with this kind of Elta sunscreen before.  I'm sadly sending it back."," March 16, 2021"
29,Kendall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for acne prone skin,"  This product is amazing for sensitive and acne-prone skin. I have had issues in the past with sunscreens breaking me out and with Elta MD I have no worries. I have been using it for about a month now per my aesthetician. I have noticed I did go through a purge but that wasn't the only new product I was testing so it could have been a combination of the two. Now after using it a month I have noticed my skin is more hydrated (it does give you a glow) honestly some days I will just put this on and go out the door, it gives you a dewy look. Also, it goes on white but turns clear as you rub it in. I have not seen any white cast after using it. Honestly, it's so amazing you don't even need a primer before makeup, I use one but some days I skip it and there is not much of a difference. This product is worth it and I will cont. to buy it. It also has no smell and the pump on it works amazing and pumps out so smoothly. 10/10"," February 19, 2020"
30,Ebiz8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product and NO WHITECAST ON DARK SKIN!,"  I have sensitive oily skin and hormonal acne. I am a brown-skinned black woman and this facial sunscreen is a godsend! It’s so hard for women with brown skin to find a sunscreen that won’t leave a whitecast or turn us grey! And the tinted ones are never our color tint. Along with my particular skin issues I thought I’d never find a good sunscreen but this product is the answer. Now that I’ve used it for a few months I can see that it does improve the quality of my skin and it seems to be reducing my blemishes slightly too though I can’t be completely  sure of the latter only because I use other products to lighten blemishes as well. I use my regular moisturizer under this product and I’ve never used it alone so I can’t say whether or not it moisturizes particularly well, but like I said, I have oily skin so it’d be hard to tell if it didn’t.  This product has never irritated my skin or been problematic in any way. It has a lovely, very light clean smell that reminds me of baby products. This will now be a regular staple in my skincare regime."," November 21, 2019"
31,JKLA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a sunscreen I can use daily,"  This is different than any other product I have ever tried.  I have hyper-pigmented Asian skin that has always been sensitive to sunscreens.  I used to avoid wearing any because I'd break out and then have dark blemishes for months afterwards.  I figured it was better to put up with the hyper pigmentation and freckles than to deal with pore clogging sunscreens.  But no more!  Elta MD absorbs so quickly into the skin and is silky smooth unlike traditional sunscreens that leave a white sheen till it's absorbed. The bottle says the zinc oxide is microionized which might be why it feels so different.  I plan on using this product before and after IPL treatment since it hasn't caused any reaction with my skin except make it look more radiant and clear.  Highly recommend for acne, sun-damaged, blemished, mid-age skin."," January 29, 2017"

33,M Norris,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pills up on Skin,"  I am a very fair-skinned individual, and have tried numerous sunscreens over the years. After hearing so much about Elta, I decided to give it a try. It may act as a great sunscreen, but that is completely overshadowed by how badly this pills up on skin. I have tried using different moisturizers underneath, to using no moisturizer, but no matter what, this pills up. I end up having to rub my face to get all the pilled-up product off, and then apply a different sunscreen afterwards. So disappointing. Definitely not worth the money, and Biore and LaRoche-Posay offer better and more affordable sunscreens that don't pill."," December 30, 2020"
34,Ellie,4.0 out of 5 stars,actually better than any primer I've tried,"  I have acne-prone skin that is very oily but can also be dry and flaky because I use tretinoin cream. I can have dry skin flaking off while my face is still covered in a sheen of oil. Lucky me, right? I prefer to utilize physical sunscreen, so I appreciate that this contains zinc oxide and only one chemical sunscreen. It does not leave a white cast on my face. This sunscreen is not very greasy, as far as sunscreens go. An unexpected bonus that I've discovered is that it actually seems to make my skin less oily during the day, actually better than any primer I've tried. It does not cause me to break out. It is decently moisturizing compared to most other physical sunscreens I've tried. However, during the winter I still need to sometimes add a more heavy duty moisturizer to some flaky areas. I use this as my everyday face sunscreen -- I cannot attest to its quality if used as a beach/sport sunscreen.-1 star because it is so expensive for such a small amount. But luckily it does last for a while even with daily use."," February 3, 2018"
35,Patilu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No white cast, no sensitivity, improving dark spots","  Life changing product. No white cast on bare skin or under foundation and much better results with prescription HYDROQUINONE/retinoid mix. Absolutely no sensation on skin or eyes.I use warm color foundations in light to medium beige range and get no white cast and use plenty of product.I noticed a positive change in results of skin lightening in 2 days. IPL and 6% HYDROQUINONE were giving me middling results as I get older. This product is helping me get results I got when I was younger. I have sensitive skin and eyes and have no problems with Elta.I've used various sunblocks, including LaRoche Posay physical and chemical. ELTA MD is far superior."," October 30, 2018"
36,Hailey,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favorite,"  I bought this because everyone raves about it. I have dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. I was looking for a non tinted mineral sunscreen that wouldn’t leave a white cast. This does not leave an obvious cast, so based on that alone - 5 stars. However, this product pills so bad. I have tried every combination of application. Over moisturizer, over a different moisturizer (initially thinking it just didn’t work well with my daily cream) and alone. Every time it pilled. If I am able to apply it without pulling, as soon as I touch my face or neck, or try to reapply, it pills. For the price, I don’t see a difference between this and Cerave daily spf 30 moisturizer. The cerave one has an almost identical color/texture/smell/pilling issue and is almost half the price. So I would recommend trying the cerave first and if you can make that work for you, then consider investing in this product. But if the cerave doesn’t work for you than this likely won’t either."," September 7, 2021"
37,lovespuppies,3.0 out of 5 stars,irritating,"  Pros: NO white cast, not greasy at all. It dries down completely and leaves you with a shine/glow, but not greasy or oily.Cons: It stings a little for me, perhaps it's the niacinamide or lactic acid. When I first put it on I get really red, then it goes away. I also got a few little pimples the first week I used it. I also had some dryness and tightness for about a week, then my skin adjusted to the lighter formula.I have been using EltaMD sunscreens exclusively this summer and have ultimately been disappointed. This one especially because it's so expensive. I do not burn or come even close when I use this brand, but it did not save me from getting new freckles. Maybe that means the UVB protection is superior to the UVA? Bottom line I don't think this is worth the price."," September 28, 2018"
38,Nam Truong,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pills horribly, flakes and clumps off","  I only added a second star because the ingredients are so good. But.. the pilling, omg the pilling. I do not understand how so many people like this, or why Dr Dray and others recommend. I tried it so many different ways... heavy application, light application, medium, light product with a silicone underneath, only moisturizer underneath, nothing underneath. Each and every time it pills and rubs off right away. Like as I was applying, and with the slightest touch of my face afterward. It rubs off in little disgusting clumps. I’m returning tomorrow. Howwww is this so popular."," May 13, 2021"
39,karyn,4.0 out of 5 stars,2 weeks using EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46,"  Overall is good.Pros: Is light weight, it absorbs fast, no white cast, you only needs a small amount, is mattifying but not drying, it is fine under makeup.Cons: If you apply other mattifying products before the sunscreen it will peel off AWFUL. For example I always do my skincare routine with 3 drops of niacinamide 10% from the ordinary + 1 pump of mattifying hydrator from Dr. Brandt then sun protection, and with EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen all the products peel off as soon as the sunscreen dries.I tried to prevent this by:1.- Reducing the amount of previous products I put on, it didn't work.2.- Waiting more time between layer to let them dry better. Didn't work.3.- Using only the sunscreen. It worked4.- Not using other mattifying products. It worked.So the product is good but it has a texture issue with other mattifying products.Another cons, for me, is that 1 pump is a lot of product, I only user half a pump, is more that enough.I will continue using this product but I don't think I will buy it again. I will continue my search of the perfect sunscreen for me."," September 23, 2020"
40,Alex C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth Trying, Great Quality!","  I got this based off numerous articles online recommending this for sensitive/rosacea prone skin. I believe everyone’s skin reacts differently and with face products you just have to go through the pain of testing. My derm no longer carries this, but derms that so may have sample sizes for free before you buy. After using this for a few weeks, I really like it. I have tried numerous mineral sunscreens and this works best under makeup. I am olive skin toned, and the fairest I’ve ever been after the pandemic, and it doesn’t leave much cast on me. If I tan some and notice this, I will update my review. The sunscreen rubs on very smooth, unlike some mineral ones that feel like grainy and uncomfortable to rub on. I think it is very moisturizing and don’t put moisturizer on with this, even though I am fighting dry skin. I have worn this to a pool with a hat, while on skin treatment that makes me more prone to sun sensitive skin, and I didn’t get any color/redness (but I reapplied faithfully). I think this product is definitely worth trying to see if it is a match for you if you are looking for a new daily sunscreen. Best of luck!"," June 27, 2021"
41,AseaNoe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does just what it says!,"  My dermatologist suggested this to me. I have tried tons of sunscreen... TONS, all price points and all brands. I prefer physical blockers but they never mesh with my makeup, make me so greasy (and I'm already oily/combo), or leave a ghostly white cast on my deep brown skin. This absorbs easily, has no strong fragrance, plays well with makeup and moisturize, is still effective is Houston summer heat and humidity, and doesn't trigger my adult acne. I haven't had issues with the pump, I like that I can pump out a lot or a little but. It is not clear - it does leave a slight white cast on my skin, however It does dissipate and I always use at least powder to make my skin more even and absorb the oilies."," August 6, 2017"
42,BEACHLOVE,5.0 out of 5 stars,TRULY CLEAR DAILY SUN PROTECTION,"  Just when I found the perfect tinted daily sunscreen, Elta MD tinted, along came Covid and face masks.  The tint is great but there is no way to wear it with a mask and not end up with stains on the inside.  So, I tried the Elta MD UV Clear, SPF 46.  Perfection!  For some reason, anything with zinc oxide stays on the surface of my skin making me look as white as Morticia Adams.  Somehow, Elta MD has found a way to provide great protection that is truly clear.  And it isn't greasy.  Other sunscreens leave your hands so oily it's hard to open bottles or insert contact lenses, even after washing your hands.  I love this product!  When we are free from masks again, I will also use the tinted.  But the clear is fabulous.  I highly recommend it."," December 1, 2020"
43,Carissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Combo/Sensitive Skin,  I originally bought an Origins moisturizer with sunscreen bc the other moisturizers I use currently (Ponds and Belif) don't have any SPF.  The Origins brand made me break out if I used it more than 1 day.  Living in South Florida and coming up on pool season (hopefully soon post-COVID) I knew I needed to try another brand. I had a few friends recommend EltaMD and the reviews online were promising for combination or sensitive skin.  I tend to fluctuate from oily to dry and if I put too much products on my face interchangeably it usually responds with a breakout.  I have used this four days in a row now and have not had any adverse reactions. I would recommend trying for those who have had bad luck with other brands. The price point alone is attractive as some other brands I had recommended were over $60 for the same or smaller portions.," April 22, 2020"
44,Sandy8,1.0 out of 5 stars,"irritating, chemical ingredient, burning my face","  In my 30s, I have decided to wear sunscreen everyday and I wanted a natural product that is gentle to be used that way.  I was fool by this so called ""mineral"" sunscreen with raving reviews. This contains chemical ingredient and thats why there is no white cast. And the ranking on EWG is at 6!!! immediately after open I smell the strong chemical sunscreen scent. all day my face was oil but it made my face felt tender and irritated.  this might be good if you are seeking a just no white cast sunscreen to use once a while. this is no way good for using everyday as the ingredients are way to toxic."," March 14, 2019"
45,reviewer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Is NOT only mineral sunscreen- contains octinoxate (chemical sunscreen)!!,"  If you are here you likely want a mineral based sunscreen.  This one contains octinoxate, a chemical UV-B filter,  along with zinc oxide (the mineral component), so it isn’t strictly a mineral sunscreen. (I guess “mineral based” means it relies somewhat but not entirely on mineral ingredients?).  You will see this fact listed under “active ingredients” (what does the blocking) not just “ingredients” (all the other stuff).  This goes on super smoothly and is a delight to wear, is sheerer than typical mineral sunscreens (probably because it isn’t truly a mineral sunscreen!) but as someone who is allergic to the “chemical”sunscreen ingredients I began to have the usual irritation after a few days of steady wear in the sun.  I wanted to love it but it bothered my skin too much to use regularly."," July 17, 2021"
46,Carolina,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pills on my skin,"  This is a solid sunscreen, but unfortunately it does not work well with my other skin care/make up routine. I use Fresh deep hydration cream first and then apply Elta MD UV clear. It pills a little bit around my forehead. Then I apply Bare Mineral rescue complexion, and my forehead pills even more. I think most of the products have rolled off. I've tried waiting in between applications but still no avail. I am still on the lookout for a good sunscreen.EltaMD does not cause whiteheads on my skin. It's transparent. It does not cause increase sebum/oil production. But it pills with my other products."," March 2, 2019"
47,DragonCeres,3.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy for summer,"  I'm surprised this is marketed for acne skin because it is pretty heavy when you first put it on and takes a good 10-15 minutes to absorb. The pro is that there's not a white cast. While I loved the 5% niacinamide in it, the fact it makes my skin oily looking isn't worth it. I'd rather just use a niacinamide serum for that benefit. Also, due to the niacinamide, I can't use vitamin C in the morning. While they can go together, it is recommended to wait 15-20 minutes for the Vit C to absorb before putting on niacinamide. B/t the Vit C absorption and the time it takes for this to fully absorb, that's 25-30 minutes before putting on any makeup. I just don't have that kind of time in the morning.Also, it's not waterproof, which is fine if you're in the office all day and just sitting in AC. However, I do think it clogs my pores a little if I'm outside more than 15 minutes in the humid summer weather. I will wait till fall/winter to finish this up and go back to finding another lighter sunscreen that doesn't clog my pores for the summer. My hunt for the perfect sunscreen continues."," August 25, 2018"
48,Sana Hadyah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why complain?,"  Bought this from local dermatologist’s office. It was priced the same. I’m leaving a review to let  online purchasers know that the bottle should, indeed, have a lot number on the bottom. Expiration date should be at least one year far out (indicates fresher product).As for the “this made me break-out” reviews, why leave a one star review? If it doesn’t work for you, move on to the next product. Life is full of trial and error. We all heard it before: “Correlation doesn’t equal causation.” You broke out, and that sucks. Ask yourself if it’s truly the sunscreen or one of the other hundreds of products you’re using. Let’s face it, you ARE using a hundred other products. It could very well be this sunscreen, but it’s a reputable brand that works for most people, not all people. Skin is delicate—some more delicate than others.Long story short, use Elta Md’s physician locator tool (on their website) to find an office that sells it to you OR buy it directly from Elta Md’s website. The cost is literally the same +- a dollar."," July 21, 2021"
49,jo of all trades,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic product,"  Was wary because of reviews saying the product would not be authentic, but did some research and saw that EltaMD does have Amazon as an authorized seller now. I received an authentic product in February 2019. As for the sunblock itself, it feels nice! It has a more greasy feel going on than the Asian milky ones like Biore, so it feels moisturizing, but the greasiness goes away after rubbing into the skin, unlike Neutrogena. No scent and no white cast even though it's a physical sunscreen!"," March 6, 2019"
50,Jackie,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZON IS AN AUTHORIZED RETAILER AS OF 2017,"  There's many reviews saying that this is a fake product but I emailed Elta MD and they said as of 2017, Amazon is an authorized retailer and If purchased through Amazon it should say ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"" or Amazon Services LLC.Just be on the lookout for third party Amazon resellers where it might say for example ""Sold By: Skincare World"". These are the Amazon resellers that are not authorized.As for my review I just bought it so I will update this once I have tested it out. just giving this five stars in hopes that others will see this."," October 22, 2020"
51,Jackson Thomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good but expensive,"  Contains mineral sunblock & chemical sunscreen. The info. on the benefits & limitations of mineral vs. chemical sunscreens is VERY confusing. Consumer Reports recommends chemical sunscreens as they test better for skin protection. CR has taken the opinion that most of the chemicals approved in the U.S, for sunscreens, are completely safe. However, many of these ingredients aren’t approved in other countries because of safety concerns. And, ironically, two of the most effective sunscreen ingredients aren’t even available in the U.S. A result of politics & corporate greed.  Some studies show that the most popular chemicals used in U.S. sunscreens  can dangerously change healthy human hormone levels. And some ingredients may, in theory, be carcinogenic!So, the EWG(I think those are the correct initials?) a health & environment safety group only recommends mineral( titanium & zinc) physical sun blocks. But, EWG focuses on safe ingredients much more than how well skin is protected from the suns rays. As long as a product states that it provides broad spectrum uva & uvb protection with an spf of 30 or above and it relies on mineral blocks,...EWG seems to approve.  Every dermatologist I’ve seen also recommends broad spectrum mineral sun blocks!?! Elta has a great reputation with most dermatologists.  It IS rather pricey though. This particular elta product combines zinc & octinoxate. Perhaps the best of both worlds?  It doesn’t leave a white cast like pure mineral sunscreens do!! Plus it contains niacinamide for skin health. However, the zinc in this product is micronized. This makes it transparent. A quick internet search will show that micronized zinc is controversial too!!  Some science shows it to be unsafe!All of this conflicting info could make people throw their hands up and just forget sunscreen all together.  I’ve decided to use brands, like Elta md., that my dermatologist approves of—but doesn’t sell. A combo of one chemical & one mineral(actually a chemical itself) that’s broad spectrum, spf 46 & doesn’t make me white or irritate my skin,  is what I’m going with.  Life is too short to obsess over sunscreen."," June 30, 2019"
52,Uncle Package,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No Sun Burn, No Acne, No Burning the Eyes","  I bought this mostly because Curology recommended it and it didn't cost $50+ per bottle. I was previously using Sun Bum SPF 30, which worked pretty well for me overall.Anyway, getting into EltaMD's SPF 46 (such a random number!) for faces...Did it have a strange smell? Yes, but as long as you're not getting super intimate with people, nobody is going to notice the smell. It's not that strong smelling.Does it leave a slight white shadow on my face? Yes, but overall, it absorbs pretty well for being SPF 46. Again, usually I use 30 or even as low as 15.When I sweat, does it burn my eyes any more than how much my own perspiration burns my eyes when I sweat? NO!!!Does it prevent sunburn on a very sunny day in August in Florida? YES!!!!Has it caused my acne prone skin to break out? NO!!!Those last 3 statements are the reasons why I give this product a 5 star review. Works just as well if not better than Sun Bum, and burns my eyes less than Sun Bum."," August 22, 2019"
53,beauty4ashes,1.0 out of 5 stars,Itchy Skin! Nope!,"  I really thought this product would be a winner...especially when I heard reviews from African American women like me saying that it didn’t leave a white cast etc. Unfortunately, this product made my skin itch sooo much! I didn’t know if it was the sunscreen or another makeup product that was giving me that reaction so I tried wearing it again with no makeup and my face was on fire! I just kept scratching and scratching. I eventually had to just use some makeup wipes I keep in my work bag to clean the product off my face. Really wish it worked for me, but issa NO! Btw, I’m not someone who has sensitive skin! No allergies, nothing...but I believe it’s the Octinoxate that my skin doesn’t agree with.

UV Clear gets glowing reviews so I thought I’d give it a try. I was confident I’d like it since I use Elta’s tinted sunscreen. Wrong. This product almost felt like it was stinging my skin and left my face feeling sticky and stiff. I’ll keep trying to see if perhaps it’s better with different moisturizers but at this point I probably won’t purchase this again. My skin leans toward being sensitive and it could be the chemical sunscreen in the product is not good with my skin.

This is by far the one I like the most. My dermatologist recommended it initially, but I ran from the price and found some by a cheaper brand& just suffered through the ever greasy feeling of protection. I finally bit the bullet& bought it..... can I just say, it's the best?? Hands down, best product ever. No break outs, no greasy feeling or white tint left behind. I use as much as moisturizer, about 20 min before going iut&it's amazing, I don't even feel like I'm wearing it. If you make this purchase, you will not regret it."," April 8, 2021"
56,Jennifer U,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far it's better than many others!,"  I've tried so many facial sunscreens. I'm on Accutane and I also have rosacea, so I need something simple yet effective. I like that this washes off pretty easily. My skin can not handle harsh cleansing. This does leave somewhat of a white cast, but honestly, I tend to like a little white cast because it helps blend in the redness from my rosacea. At first I thought the product was pilling, until I realized it was dry skin and not the product. So, it does catch on dry skin, but this can be remedied with using the right moisturizer beforehand. I've also noticed that it helps to apply the product shortly after your moisturizer while it's fresh on the skin instead of waiting. It does leave a little shine, but it's not overly shiny and can be matted down with a little powder. If I could change one thing, I think I would like it to be a little more matte, but not at the risk of adding more silicones which tend to feel heavy. Although I'm not super in love with this product, it is one of the better ones I have tried, and I've tried a lot! Perhaps with continued use I will see the benefits and learn to love it more."," February 18, 2022"
57,LP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for me,"  I find it interesting reading reviews because many times one contradicts the next one.  I have been using this product for many years first recommended by a dermatologist.  I have cystic acne which is not impacted by the product.  I find the sunscreen relatively light, not greasy, very little fragrance, and only see white patches if I use too much.  I put it on every morning after washing my face and before putting on makeup.  It does not effect how my makeup goes on and I don't use a moisturizer in the morning.  I reapply if I am going out in the sun for an extended period of time.  My daughter is now using it too.  I bought the face and body version for summer time and it worked well."," January 1, 2021"

The first bottle (several months ago) I used and dumped the rest in the trash. Now, my second go at it with another bottle and I'm starting to get that itch of -- 'throw the whole thing away'. For a guy with brown skin and who uses Retin-A gel, this Elta/MD Clear, DOES leave a white cast, ESPECIALLY IF you apply it twice in a day, without washing your face to remove the first application. My look...... my face..... well, it will send you screaming with night sweat. I guess, for color people, it's okay to wear around the house and that's about it. I also find it to be a bit drying, if applied alone. I'm NOT sure what the raves and hypes are all about. I believe Clinique's mineral sunscreen are better than this one, at least when applied over my face lotion."," June 4, 2019"

At 66 years of age I decided it was time to have a sunscreen on my face. My dermatologist recommended this one. I use it every day now over top of my moisturizer. It took a while but my skin looks so much more amazing and healthy now. I would not go out in the sun without it on. It makes a huge difference. It’s a little pricey for most people but this little bottle last a really long time. You don’t need much.

60,leslie lopez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pricey but worth it for sensitive skin!,"  Short review: Great for sensitive skin and does not clogs my pores. Pump once, a little bit of product goes a long way. No greasy residue on me. Worth the money. Wish it was cruelty free though. Does not moisturize much but does not dry out either. Helps a bit with oily areas in face like t-zone.Long review:I was recommended this product by my friend who struggles with acne-prone skin. I don’t struggle as much with acne as I do with just sensitive skin in general, but she said this would be great for that too and I’m glad I listened. I spent so much time doing research and trying to find a more affordable  one that would work for my skin and after trying some, they would all make me break out or turn my skin red. I finally caved and purchased this sunscreen and although I wish it was cruelty free, I can say that it is worth the money. After wearing it for two months, I can see a difference in my skin complexion. My pores do not clog like they did with other facial spf and doesn’t leave a sticky or greasy residue. I will say though that a little goes a long way so careful when you pump, not to pump too much or it will go to waste. Learned that the hard way. Also, I have dry skin for the most part and it doesn’t moisturize it much for me but doesn’t dry it out either. I apply my usual moisturizer then the sunscreen. The sunscreen has oil-absorbing ingredients that help me around my chin, my pinky oily area since I have to wear a mask for work all day and been breaking out around my chin as a result. Overall, I would recommend. It’s like the perfect mix for people with dry and oily skin, it’s crazy how good it works for both skin types, and unless I find a cheaper sunscreen that works as good or better than this, I won’t be switching any time soon."," October 12, 2020"
61,Jeannie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very irritating for eyes,"  Pros: The sunscreen is easy to spread and doesn't leave a white cast. I do think it helped with my mild rosacea this year. I like that it has niacinamide.Cons: I started to use this sunscreen beginning of May 2021 and my eyes were so itchy during the summer. So I assumed that my allergies were getting worse, but in fact it was the EltaMd sunscreen irritating my eyes. I realized that my eyes were never itchy on days I didn't use the sunscreen. I have dry skin, but live in a very humid area. The EltaMd sunscreen slides off my face and into my eyes. I worked from home all summer and my eyes would get so irritated looking at the computer. Also the sunscreen contains octinoxate, as an active chemical for sun protection and this chemical is not reef safe."," September 4, 2021"
62,Liz Heintz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed Feelings,"  I may be the weirdo here, but I really don't like this product, as many times as I've tried to love it. It's too shiny, it almost leaves a ""plastic"" film, and it tends to feel gritty and ball (you cannot put on multiple layers of this product). I do like the high protection and ingredients, just can't stand the texture. I honestly prefer the ""new and improved"" Coppertone Faces Clear Zinc SPF 50 much better...similar ingredients (zinc/chemical combo), just for me, much creamier in texture and plays better with my makeup!

63,Mike P,1.0 out of 5 stars,Causes itching once I begin to perspire,"  I had tried this product on my face from a friend during a mild, sunny San Diego day last December where much of the time was spent indoors and several minutes out in the sun here and there, with casual walking but no mild or moderately intense physical activity.  It felt fine! I was excited to fully switch to this because La Roche-Posay, which I do generally like, turns orange after being in the sun for long periods of time. Upon finishing my La Roche bottles, I began using this Elta product.  Sadly, any time I begin to perspire even a little (ex: getting into a warm car on a warm, not hot, summer day and that couple of minutes while you wait for the air conditioning to cool the car, or walking from my car to the office while carrying a couple of moderately heavy bags), the skin where I used this Elta product becomes so itchy! This has happened on multiple occasions to the point where I don’t wear this outside of the house in case I need to wash it off.  I do use Retin-A nightly (I have been using it for years), and Cetaphil for moisturizer.  Not sure if that’s part of the problem.  Time to try a different product and return to La Roche to hold me over..."," September 12, 2021"
64,Christan de Luna,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great ingredients and feels amazing on skin, but breaks me out","  Decided to buy this due to the hype this product gets (as well as it having decent UVA protection and it being fungal acne-safe), and I understand why, but it's not for me, as the octinoxate breaks me out (first time discovering that I'm sensitive to this ingredient after using this). After I stopped using it on my face, I decided to use it on the back of my hands and arms, and I literally got a whitehead on my hand the next day, which is the first time I've ever gotten a pimple there. It was crazy. So much for being a product geared towards sensitive skin. It also smells very sunscreen'y. I will say, though, that it has great ingredients, feels great on skin, and is easy to apply and spread.To confirm to make sure that I really was sensitive to octinoxate, I decided to buy DRMTLGY's tinted dupe version of this, which is also fungal acne-safe. Their version is definitely much better (especially because it was absolutely fragrance and scent-free), but alas, that one broke me out too."," August 8, 2021"
65,MayBae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Far exceeded my expectations!,"  This was a recommendation on a website as a good SPF moisturizer that doesn’t clog your pores.  I didn’t really read too much about it, just ordered it and started slapping it on.  It’s not super thick and does make my skin a little shiny at first, although not as bad as others do.  After a couple days, my skin started clearing up and my first thought was that I should have started using SPF years ago if this was the result of blocking UV rays!  Then I saw it had niacinamide in it, haha.  Well, it works!  I’ve tried other niacinamide products before and none of them have given me the results that this SPF moisturizer does.  It’s on the pricier side, but I have no problems shelling out for it as long as this is the result...especially since my skin hadn’t been doing so great with all the extra mask wearing."," August 22, 2020"
66,johnatjax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great texture & protection,"  Love this sunscreen! Bought it last June 2019 at a dermatology office after trying my cousin's bottle.  I used almost every day since then on face, neck, upper chest & ears and it lasted til 2 months ago.  Bought current bottle on Amazon & it works just as well.  I am very oily skinned and this doesnt make me too much oilier.  I love that even though it says its not water resistant, I can put it on & go out for the day & even jogging and still not get burned.  (I nornally burn very easily and have had 2 skin cancers surgically removed in the past).  It has just enough white tone to it to tone down my reddish colored skin tone, which I like, because normally I wear a light foundation to tone down the red.  The texture is an easy-to-spread lotion unlike some of the thick zinc sunscreens."," May 6, 2020"
67,Abby Perrott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I would have found this years ago,"  I seriously wish I would have found this facial sunscreen years ago; I'm sure my face would look better now if I had. I'm 41 and struggle with sensitive facial skin and brown sun/aging spots on my face from years of unprotected sun exposure - before I knew better! I hated putting sunscreen on my face because it always felt so gross and was almost impossible to put make up over. I also didn't know there were 2 types of sunscreens - chemical and mineral. I have been using chemical all over my face for years. No wonder I hated it so much. Not only is this sunscreen the much safer mineral kind, but it's so easy to spread evenly over my face and it leaves no white residue. It also doesn't feel greasy or oily and my powder make up easily goes over it. I will use this sunscreen on my face and my daughter's face forever! I'll never buy anything different. I highly recommend this sunscreen. I can see why it has so many high reviews - it's the best out there!"," July 8, 2021"

69,youngju,1.0 out of 5 stars,It felt like a regular store bought cheap UV cream,"  I've been using the elta md clear UV lotion for the past 5 years using this seller but I had to return the item this time. The product was not the same. It was thicker, no fresh cooling effects  I when applied. It felt like a regular store bought cheap UV cream. It never questioned on authenticity of products from this seller until now. I better purchase through a physician' office."," April 30, 2018"
70,Alexis D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen I've tried!,"  After watching a TikTok from @whatsonvisface she recommended this product. I decided to try it because her skin is amazing. I was hesitant about the price at first because I'm cheap. I think it will last me 4-6 months of one time daily use honestly. I have combination skin. I can apply this immediately after my shower and it absorbs within 5 minutes. I usually get oily halfway through the day with most products, however I can go ALL DAY without my T-zone becoming oily with this! It spreads like freaking butter! The amount shown on my fingers can easily be used on my face and neck. The smell isn't overbearing like most sunscreens. I had issues with other sunscreens melting into my eyes and burning but haven't had any issues with this one yet. Doesn't make my face shiny AT ALL or feel sticky EVER. I will be buying this from now on unless I get a better one for free! lolThese are the sunscreens I've tried - Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF 25, Neutrogena Clear Face sunscreen lotion SPF 55 oil-free and there was another generic kind from Walmart. Hydro Boost was expensive for how much I had to use. Clear face made my face oily all day."," November 9, 2020"
71,Kristen,2.0 out of 5 stars,Flakes and peels on the skin!,"  (The flakiness/peeling in the pictures was a very mild example. It has been much worse before)This sunscreen has good protection. It didn't cause any skin reactions in me and I normally have sensitive skin, so this product would be good in that department. For appearances, it would probably be fine on a casual and laid-back day, IF/WHEN you can get it to actually blend well enough to sit on the skin properly... I've had days where it works good, and enhances my skin. But sadly, that's a rarity.Most days, I have a lot of trouble out of it. It is horrible under makeup. It also drys too fast. It drys before I even get it blended in and then will start to peel and flake all over the skin. I've had to completely rewash my face and redo my entire routine after using this sunscreen. The flakiness is everywhere!I've even had people comment on the flakes near my hairline because it's so horrible that it ends up all in the front of my hair like dandruff.I ended up purchasing this twice (thinking maybe I got a bad batch, etc).Needless to say, I decided to just buy a different SPF. This is now my ""last resort/backup"" SPF just in case my other runs out."," March 14, 2021"
72,Hiba,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst product ever-destroyed my face with breakouts,"  I was so excited to get this sunscreen but my face started breaking within the second or third day!! All the areas I applied the sunscreen on , face and neck, developed painful pimples that turned black when healing. Of course I stopped using it, but the breakouts on my face and neck are still increasing and I don’t even know where to begin fixing my face. Literally the worst thing I’ve ever bought through Amazon."," August 27, 2021"
73,jhvoorhies,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure to order from amazon. Not another seller.,"  I previously purchased this about a year ago and I feel like I received a counterfeit product.A couple weeks ago, I repurchased. I've used it every day since and my skin had no negative reactions. This sunscreen does not pill or irritate my acne prone/redness prone skin. It did sting a bit for the first couple days but not anymore.I do not think it clogs my pores as much as other sunscreens. I really love this product. I have no deal complaints at all!I highly recommend this if you're acne prone and oily. It's probably the best for humid environments but this is a solid sunscreen. I'm rating it a 9 out of 10. I don't think I've ever loved another sunscreen this much."," July 4, 2019"
74,Rebecca,5.0 out of 5 stars,"SERIOUSLY, BEST SUNSCREEN!!! Will buy for life.","  I’m not one to write reviews but I’ve been telling myself ever since I bought this sunscreen, I must write one. Let me start off by saying I have sensitive skin that is easily prone to hyperpigmentation/ rosacea. Also, I’ve always dreaded and (unfortunately, avoided) putting sunscreen on my face my whole life. I hated how much greasier my already greasy skin looked. I disliked the smell, how it felt, everything. Fast forward to using this sunscreen and I ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING IT ON. I’ve even applied it on days I don’t plan to go outside because of how moisturizering it is, my skin comes alive when I apply it. There’s no strong smell, I sometimes have allergic reactions to perfume-y smells. It’s not greasy. DOESN’T leave your face white like other sunscreens ( very confused by any comments which say it does). I swear it makes my skin look good once I apply it, plump and more even toned skin, this stuff is magic (who agrees?!) It’s summer so when I ran out and was waiting for my order I noticed my skin was getting back to what it used be before I discovered this - hyperpigmented due to the sun. So now I know for sure this sunscreen is why my skin has looked better than any past summers. Because of all the pros, I do not mind paying this much for sunscreen. I’m a product lover, I enjoy researching the best products for everything and try many until I find The One and this right here is one of my all time favorite products I own."," September 1, 2019"
75,Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pills Badly, broke me out","  This product has such incredible reviews and it's recommended by so many people, but it didn't work for me. I tried it multiple times and every time, I got tiny little pimples that popped up later that day and sometimes the next day. I waited for the pimples to go away and gave it another try, same thing happened. Also, the consistency is pretty awful in my opinion. It pilled so badly on my face. I would apply my moisturizer and wait a few minutes for it to soak into my skin. Then I would go in with the sunscreen. It's extremely white and took a lot of rubbing to blend into my skin. Then it just would pill at the edges of my face. It's worse when I reapplied (since you have to apply sunscreen every two hours). I just had pills/globs of sunscreen all over that wouldn't bled in. It was so icky."," June 1, 2020"
76,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I like it, but I don't love it","  Notes on me: I have medium-toned skin, I used the whole bottle over the entire summer and I still have quite a bit left. This sunscreen does a lot of things right: no white cast (if you have white cast, you're using too much), no strong scents, it's easy to spread and it's a very reliable and effective broad spectrum sunscreen. BUT personally, I don't love how it sits on my skin and after my routine it pills a little too much for my liking. I'm on the fence or whether I would purchase again because for the price point I have to believe there's a sunscreen I'd like more out there. That being said, my skin is still soft, no major break outs. , This is a very solid every day option especially for the face"," September 15, 2021"
77,JenK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen Ever,"  I've tried a lot of stuff cuz my skin is pretty sensitive, and hands down, the best sunscreen I’ve tried is EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46. It’s mineral-based, fragrance-free, contains lactic acid and hyaluronic acid, which keep my skin super hydrated and smooth. EltaMD doesn't leave a white cast (still wait at least 10 min before applying makeup) and sits well under makeup. Some people swear by the tinted one, but I was not too fond of it. I'm picky about my sunscreen because I had stage 3 melanoma in my late 20s (thanks, tanning beds), so now I’m skincare obsessed, and surprisingly I've been able to reverse most of the sun damage!"," November 25, 2021"
78,MissTEX,5.0 out of 5 stars,This seller has LEGIT PRODUCT!,"  As a longtime Elta MD user, I can say the product I received is the real deal.My bottle arrived in a sealed box that had the batch# and Expiration date on the bottom. The bottle has the correct nozzle top as well as the batch# and expiration date on the bottom.The UV clear (both tinted & clear) is my ride or die MUST HAVE  daily moisturizer. I love that it does so beautifully under makeup that it can truly double as a primer! That was a fabulous tip I received from my esthetician who is also a makeup artist. This stuff is loaded with antioxidants & other skin-loving ingredients.Elta MD UV- Clear is worth every penny!!!!"," October 13, 2020"
79,Rosa,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work on me,  I had really high expectations about this product. It advertises that it’s good for skin with rosacea. Last Saturday was the first time I put it on and inmediately my skin had a reaction. I didn’t think it was the product so the day after I put it back again and my face turned bright red. Monday I woke up with brakeouts and my skin was so sensitive. I am not sure if this product conflicted with my face treatments I follow for my condition but  have to say I has made my skin worse. I hope is not your case but please if you buying this be very careful and just put some in a section of your skin first before you try it in your entire face. You don’t want it to react bad like mine did.," February 27, 2019"
80,Melissa Gannon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the one,"  I wanted to love this, and I was so excited to find it because maybe, finally, I found a sunscreen that wouldn’t break me out in a terrible rash. Unfortunately, this wasn’t the case. Terrible rash, redness and ugly bumps all over my face the day after using. I liked the texture of the sunscreen and was so hopeful, but it wasn’t meant to be."," July 30, 2021"
81,Tbonita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted exactly one month :( but will repurchase,"  I adore this sunscreen... defo in my top 3. I wear spf 365 days per year from sun up to sun down. Rain or shine, winter or summer. I also reapply during day. This ran dry exactly one month after I purchased it. I do not reapply using the same; I have many awesome sunscreens in the rotation (2 other faves are biore aqua rich & supergoop superscreen). This still ran out sooo quick. I will buy again though. I am 41, normal skin, like when sunscreens are absorbed into nothing feeling or looking, don’t make me shiny (or less common, dry me out) and of course offer amazing sun protection!"," February 19, 2020"
82,Jay T.,4.0 out of 5 stars,this is a great sunscreen. It is both physical and chemical,"  Mostly, this is a great sunscreen. It is both physical and chemical, but it goes on clear and smooth. It has Niacinamide in it, which is great for skin, but the chemical it uses as sunscreen, Octinoxate, is terrible for the skin and causes premature aging. This is why it contains Niacinamide as well, to hopefully counteract the negative impact of Octinoxate, and possibly even have positive results. However, this has not been proven to work in lab tests. So I can't give it 5 stars because there is no way to know for sure if this is having a net positive or negative result on my skin, besides protecting me from the sun (which it does very well)."," May 18, 2018"
83,Lil Baby Sis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great protection that you need for your face!,"  I never thought much about applying sunscreen to my fact just to run out to the mail box and back.  Now I do.  Whether you have had a skin-cancer or not, this item was highly recommended to me as a really good sunscreen protection for the face, and to wear it every time I go outside.  It has SPF46, is very light weight when applied, smooth and not sticky.  Once applied you don't even feel it on your face and I really like that.  I use it by itself sometimes, or with moisturizer alone and also with makeup.  It's a smaller pump container than I expected for the price but I found very quickly that you don't need a whole lot to cover your face.  A little dab of this protection goes a long way and you are worth it!"," August 28, 2021"
84,Erika,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,"  I think this is kind of pricy for sunscreen and was hesitant but it's AMAZING. Since starting on a new face medication, my dermatologist wouldn't stopped recommending that I wear sunscreen regularly. I really hate the smell of sunscreen, the white sheen it always leaves, and it always ends up breaking me out, even if they say they're made for acne-prone skin.This is the first sunscreen I have ever bought that1. Smells amazing2. Doesn't break me out3. Doesn't leave a white sheen on my face"," June 27, 2017"
85,AA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product,  Couldn't find a lot of stores that sold this brand of sunscreen online. Glad that I found this on Amazon and hoping it's real/legit! It's always scary buying beauty or skin care products and not wanting a knock off that will ruin your skin. So far I'm loving this product. It feels smooth on my skin and no heavy fragrance. I am pleased with the product and see why it's so highly recommended by dermatologists. Was doing my research and was hesitant with the price point compared to other name brand face sunscreen products but this seems worth it.," February 1, 2021"
86,Elsie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not really worth the $$$$,"  I find this to be quite expensive for the price. It's such a small bottle and the pump makes it great for travel/keeping it in your bag, but it is so expensive!!! I also find it to leave an ugly cast despite it being the ""Clear"" version. It's not as bad as other sunscreens, but it is so not worth the price. Several other sunscreens, American and Asian, do a better job."," May 8, 2019"
87,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect daily sunscreen for combination skin,  I loveeeee this sunscreen. It's my favorite. I've been using this for almost a year and have gone through multiple bottles. It is superior to any other brand I've tried (Supergoop included). I even wear it when I'm not sure if I'll be going outside because it's just a natural step in my routine now. I use it after vitamin C serum and it's the perfect amount of moisturizer - it's great under makeup or alone. I have combination skin and this does not break me out. I like this better than the Unseen Sunscreen by Supergoop which feels more like a silicon base (feels a lot like a makeup primer).," December 15, 2020"
88,Nathalie Schrans,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen I have EVER used,"  I’m obsessed with skincare products, especially trying new sunscreens for my face. I’ve tried many, many face sunscreens, and the EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen is the best one I’ve ever used.It’s great for sensitive skin, and contains only FA-safe ingredients, if that’s a concern for you. It’s moisturizing and contains niacinamide, which is great for brightening skin and improving overall texture/evenness. It doesn’t sit too heavy on your face either, so you can apply makeup over it without any issues. Absolutely no pilling either, unlessyou’re applying it over a thicker serum, like niacinamide, but any sunscreen would pill over niacinamide. It layers beautifully over my morning vitamin C serum.I’m literally only ever buying this face sunscreen in the future. It’s a little pricy, but it has high SPF protection (SPF 46 should block at least 97% of UVA/UVB rays) and is so comfortable on my face that I forget it’s there. I recommend this to anyone, but especially people with sensitive skin!"," May 19, 2020"
89,Flutterby ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,  I had a hard time finding a SPF that I can use without breaking out. So far this works well. You do need to wait a few minutes for it to dry before you put foundation on. It doesn’t mix well with foundation if it isn’t dry. I don’t see a white cast either.," August 30, 2021"
90,SwissMiss777,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this!!!!!!,"  Very expensive for the amount you get so I can’t afford to buy it again but my honest opinion follows.I was recommended this product by my dermatologist as I have melasma and oily skin. I’ve given up on sunscreens because they were like wearing greasy cake makeup. Even the ones for oily skin were an odd texture.Well this product is a lifesaver or shall I say skin saver! The texture is amazing, it’s high quality and my skin loves it! It is not greasy and does not feel like it’s a thick coat on my skin.I’m in Aesthetics school and I was telling my friend about it and two people in class chimed in with how much they love the product too. They have acneic skin and have no issues with this breaking them out.I will continue to buy this product. So happy I was introduced to it!"," December 18, 2020"
91,J. Trivett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Anti-Aging Protection and When Using Retinoids,"  I bought this after watching recommendations and reviews from Dr. Dray, a board-certified Dermatologist on YouTube. I purchase many of the products she talks about; however, for the price, I was a little hesitant about this product.I’m glad to say I’m completely blown away and will be purchasing more! While the size may not “look” the most impressive, the ingredients in it, including mineral sunscreens, are perfect for blocking BOTH UVA AND UVB. I commute to work and while the windshield of the car may block one of the two, it does not block the non burning, AGING UV rays. I apply this every morning after my morning facial routine which includes Tretinoin 0.1%. Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative and is hundreds times stronger than retinol, such as from Olay, L’Oréal, etc. and is FDA APPROVED for anti-aging. The caveat is it makes your skin extremely sensitive to the sun and sunburn.This sunscreen alone is moisturizing and provides great coverage for me. It is not nearly as pasty white as other sunscreens and creates a bit of a “primer” effect by blurring pores and giving your skin a bright, not white, appearance. Occasionally I’ll add a pure mineral sunscreen under my eyes for further protection and help with any dark circles (I’m a night shift Registered Nurse and work 3 12hr shifts in a row) and let it sit while I drive and then rub it into the rest of my face. I have not experienced any breakouts or issues with this product and one pump of the container is more than enough for your face; however, two pumps is perfect for my face, décolleté, and hands as I commute to the hospital.When I am close to running out I will most definitely order more as it seems to last much longer than expected and works as a great moisturizer (all sunscreens are moisturizers really...), sunscreen, and primer."," August 18, 2020"
92,Jane C K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Facial Sunblock for the Entire Family,"  Best facial sunblock that was used daily by all members of the family during our 11 day road trip, which included hikes, beach, rafting and just lounging about.  It was applied to two adults and 2 smaller children to face, ears and neck.  No one burned, and all 4 of us would. Left so streaks or we all tanned a shade or two.  I personally used it above moisturizer and under light foundation.  Otherwise, everyone just wore after a quick face wash.  Easy to reapply.  I actually forgot to apply to myself on our last day, and now my forehead nose and upper cheeks are burned red.  I appreciate the zinc oxide, the packaging and pump, ease of application, quick absorption, and minimal white cast."," June 21, 2021"
93,Elizabeth,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for oily skin,"  It makes my face oily, especially after about an hour. I wouldn’t recommend this if your main concern is oiliness.It moisturizes okay, but I ended up having to put moisturizer underneath because it doesn’t help to moisturize the dry spots that I get on my skin from acne. I would recommend using a SMALL amount of lightweight moisturizer underneath if you have dry skin issues too. I use la Roche posay matte face moisturizer because it does not make my face oily at all.There is no strong sunscreen smell that a lot of SPFs have. Overall, I like it more than the previous SPF moisturizers I’ve used, but I don’t think I’ll buy again when I use this up."," December 15, 2020"
94,The Wendy Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy f’ing grail!,"  I have tried over 30 brands of sunscreen this year alone. This is my top pic. This is moisturizing, gentle on my skin even though I have super sensitive skin. It helps with my redness and I’m shocked it’s not a physical sunscreen. Usually chemical sunscreens irritate me. It doesn’t work as well as zinc oxide (physical), but it has zero white cast. And where I didn’t notice a difference in my skin tone immediately, I did notice a significant decrease in my redness after 2 weeks.I see reviews that say this is counterfeit, I bought this here and 1 from the brands site directly, used 1 on each side of my face and both felt and performed the same. They also had the same expiration date and packaging."," April 15, 2021"
95,MV,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yuck,"  I tried with this product. The first time I used it, while it did smell pretty bad, I didn't mind how it looked on my skin. Slowly, with more frequent use, it seemed to really dry my skin out and CLING like no other to ANY little dry area I had. It also balls up SO bad - who wants to deal with that every morning? Balling up so bad that there were many times I wanted to rewash my face and start all over again. What gives ELTA MD?? So not only did it ball up it also clung for its life to any area that was dry. It honestly just started to look and feel disgusting. So disappointed. It's like the longer I used it, the worse and more dry my skin got. Not sure what it was but something about it my skin hated and I can't fathom continuing to use this every day. Not a great way to start your morning, with an awful smell, little balls of white all over your face, and your dry spots highlighted with flaking white sunscreen. This is not the perfect daily sunscreen. It turned me off from wanting to try any ELTA product."," January 11, 2021"
96,TXMomof2,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT PURCHASE. Left me with painful acne rash & sunburned face,  While this product came recommended via an article I read online it did not live up to expectations. This product was suppose to prevent sunburn and help prevent acne break outs from applying sunscreen. Instead I got a horrible painful acne rash on both cheeks after using this just once. To add insult to injury it did NOT provide sunscreen protection and it gave both my child and I a sunburn on our face & necks. The price of the product suggests that it a higher end item but it was the worst facial product I've ever used. My face is now Very painful and I am sorely disappointed. Save your money and buy a drugstore sunscreen because this does NOT work.," June 16, 2021"
97,A. Watman,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I could use this,"  I want to give this product a 5 star review because I like it. Unfortunately, I seem to have an allergic reaction.I love the way it applies, and it doesn’t make me break out. In fact, I think my skin improved. But, I started seeing that my eyes were swollen in the morning after wearing it. I also had some swelling on my face which was noticeable because I had creases on my cheek after sleeping on that side.However, my husband is able to use it without any problems, so it’s now his. I saw that some others had a reaction but were able to use a different Elta sunscreen. So I’m trying that, and hoping it works for me."," June 27, 2021"
98,SerenityDiva,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love love this!,"  I am undergoing treatment for skin issues similar to melasma and I have to watch the sun.  Problem is (1) I HATE oily or heavy sunscreens, (2) I prefer a block but without a white cast and (3) I hate scented crap.This stuff works great!  I’ve been under treatment for some time but using La Roche Posey which is ok It is a little greasy on me and leaves a DEFINITE white cast.So after about six months I opted to try this as physicians I know swear by this line.It isn’t heavy.  It isn’t oily.  It goes on white but once rubbed in disappears and leaves a healthy not greasy glow.  I wish it was waterproof as I swim daily, but I use their chemical one for that hour.IMO if you’ve tried all the “dry block” type sunscreens and hates them, this might work for you too."," August 12, 2020"
99,Saralan C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works for me, but...","  This is the only sunscreen, so far, that hasn’t given me any rashes, break me out, or burn my skin. My skin is super sensitive, so I still do feel a little tingling, occasionally, but nothing uncomfortable. The main reasons why I did not give the product five stars are the following: unfortunately it is not water resistant, so it might not be ideal for sports; and everyone has a different skin, and while this is what works best for me, it might not be the case for everyone. As a moisturizer this did not do much for me (all sunscreens dry my skin out, some worse than others). So here is how I compensate for that factor. After washing my face, while still wet, I apply a hyaluronic based gel (thanks dr. Dray for the tip), I then slather on a moisturizer, and let it dry. Finally, I apply the sunscreen; that is the only way it won’t dry and make my skin peel. Cast wise, this sunscreen applies very nicely and smoothly, and does not leave any white cast (I did notice, however, that it might pill depending on what moisturizer you wear underneath). It does not feel or leave your skin greasy, but it does leave you with a little [dry] shine. OVERALL, with all that said, while the price is not the friendliest, I think that it’s worth the try if you’re looking for a good sunscreen that won’t irritate your skin."," August 26, 2019"
100,Jonathan N.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Calming, glides on to skin","  Calming and super easy to spread. I have never burned once when using this product (and reapplying) and I use both retinoids and AHA/BHA in my skincare routine. I moisturizes the skin and actually calms redness like it says (tinted or non-tinted). Plus the glider of the sunscreen is flawless and it never cakes, even with multiple uses. I noticed that after I stopped using it, my skin started breaking out a bit more, which makes me think the niacinamide is significant. You'll glow to the gods (so if you prefer matte finish, dont buy this). Love it and will buy forever."," June 4, 2021"

I usually don’t spend so much on a “sunscreen .” I’m so glad I made the investment and in the long run it turns out I’m really saving money . This is the absolute best product for my sensitive, “ aging” skin. I’m in my middle 50’s . I had melanoma a few years ago & so I take my sunscreen seriously . I also try to hang on to a youthful appearance as long as I can so keeping up with a vigilant skincare routine for my face is important . This is a great product that takes care of a few steps  at once. It moisturizes , protects and heals sensitive skin, plus it’s transparent ... excellent for those who have  medium toned skin color & wear make up. This is great to wear under your best foundation ! I have tried countless products that leave that horrible cast making me look gray or ashy . This DOES NOT !"," July 6, 2020"

I have very sensitive skin and im very alergic to any type of fragrance. I dont know how long this bottle will last but with one pump is more than enough per application. I am very pleased with this product. I know it’s pricey but trust me is worth every penny."," September 6, 2020"
103,CoffeeLover23,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for acne prone skin,"  I have acne prone skin due to genetics on both sides, as well as skin cancer. According to my aunts cancer doctor sunscreen will protect the chance of me getting it at a high percentage. Considering this cancer is caused by the sun and is genetic and have had fam members pass from it I decided I needed it in my daily routine even at night yes. The UV rays are still out. Sunscreen also helps with aging as well as water and sleep of course. All this info made me have the need to get some.  Using this product, its easy to spread and a little goes a long way. I use half a pump, maybe less, for my whole face. It isn't white on your face lol it does make it a little shiny which is okay cuz well it's sunscreen. It doesn't smell like sunscreen so I like that. It almost doesn't have a scent to me. And it also adds moisture for my skin which is good since its always dry. Stay blessed and take care of yourself!"," September 18, 2021"
104,Kristen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product burned my face,"  I have sensitive skin and was told etlamd was GOOD for sensitive skin. I’m wondering if this was even the real thing or if I had received a knock off, so I’d recommend you buy directly through eltamd if you want their products. I gave the UV clear lotion and PM lotion a week chance. Skin absorbed it fast, but my face felt tight and very dry after putting it on. It was very uncomfortable. I tried applying the moisturizer several times to see if it helped but it made the problem worse. I started to develop a rash on my face which turned into red burnt looking scales. This product burned my skin. Took about a week not using this to recover from the burn. I do not recommend."," March 7, 2021"
105,brusly,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"  I am user of the EltaMD's face and body sunscreen UV Pure. As good as that one works for me and the only one so far that actually works for my skin type, it leaves a white cast. Therefore, I looked elsewhere. After research I stumbled upon this one as the one that does not leave a white cast. The day after initial application on my face, I noticed that my skin began to feel hot and with me this is the first sign of an allergic reaction. My skin then became taut and sticky at the peak of the reaction and left a rash. It then settled by drying up my skin. If it weren't for my reaction and allergy to the ingredient I believe Octinoxate, I would've given 5 stars and would become my new go-to sun screen. Because this really does blend in well and not leave a white cast. It's also very thin and not as thick as UV Pure. Oh well, I'd rather have a white cast than a rash. If you find that this product does not work I'd highly recommend trying UV Pure."," January 29, 2022"
106,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Counterfeit or expired? Who knows,"  Not sure if I received a counterfeit or expired item. Once applied the product sheds like a snake. Don’t even know how to describe it, can’t wear it at all because it is like if I had gotten a sunburn and the skin is coming off. Awful, haven’t had this problem in the past and I’ve been using the same brand for over a year. Like I said it must have been a counterfeit or expired."," December 15, 2020"
107,Stacy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not absorb,"  I’m sure that this works just fine in blocking UV rays, but it does not absorb into your skin. Whenever I use it, I can still see the opaque white sheen that makes my face look paler than the rest of me - it just sits on top of my skin. When I touch my face, product rubs off in chunks. I went to get a facial and my aesthetician thought my skin was peeling.I was really hoping to love this product because of all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed.I recommend trying a different brand. I switched to supergoop and really like it so far - absorbs immediately and very hydrating!"," October 7, 2021"
108,Eva Keast,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caused rash/bumps,"  I honestly really liked this stuff because it’s not oily at all and made my face feel great but after only 2 days of usage I broke out in a rash all over my face. I originally thought the sunscreen just didn’t work very well because my face was red, but I did not get sunburnt, just a rash. I don’t have sensitive skin whatsoever and have NEVER gotten any type of rash on my face nor my body. Hoping I’ll somehow be able to get my money back since I only used twice and broke out. :("," September 16, 2018"
109,Red pet,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, NOT for sensitive skin","  If you have eczema, sensitive skin, use chemical peels and/or use prescription topical acne/wrinkle creams —this Product is likely Not for you.If you can tolerate the few minute long burning, you will probably find it not be gentle enough to use daily. (After the initial burn) It does provide a nice sheen & works well under makeup or alone.I'm going to use this sparingly even though this product requires more re-applications.A more mineral physical barrier/thicker non irritating, no odd ingredients sunscreen (Totlogic) requiring less reapplication works better for my sensitive skin despite it can cast a bit of a lighter skin shade (fades)."," December 11, 2019"
110,nina1984,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mixed feelings about this product,"  I think this is the first face sunscreen I use that doesn't break me out. I have tried many trust me, and this is good stuff.  Also, it doesn't make me cry like most of the face sunscreen I have tried. Basically, I trashed so many face sunscreens because they caused allergies on my eyes and made me cry. I need to use this product (UV clear) after moisturizing otherwise it's a dry product for my face. What I don't like it's that it has some white color for my skin tone, maybe because I  am kind of tan from the summer. It makes my face shinny (not oily tho), but I cannot use it without the moisturizer first, but I fix the shinny look with make up which runs really well after applying this sunscreen. I will keep using it, because it doesn't make me break up and cry, which is something I couldn't find in other sunscreens, but I will have to keep looking to other products to try to find a sunscreen that doesn't make my face shinny."," October 30, 2019"
111,Zeph,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good effort but not invisible.,"  I was skeptical when I saw it said clear zinc oxide because those things are usually mutually exclusive. But I gave it a shot since it came up on several best clear sunscreen lists.It’s not clear. Its white and has that purple tint, and while you can rub it in better than most zinc oxide sunscreens. It still leaves a faint white tint that dulls the complexion if you’re black or brown. I love having my face look dewy with a glow when I moisturize, so I can’t use this and I’m sending it back. Also the description should be adjusted to “almost clear” because it’s currently misleading."," May 20, 2021"
112,Allison Salinas,3.0 out of 5 stars,The tinted version is better,"  I LOVE this sunscreen. To begin with I'm a sunscreen feen, I apply twice a day, sometimes even three if I can. I've tried so many and this one is my favorite. Unfortunately, I bought the clear kind instead of the tinted. The tinted blends into the skin so beautifully and gives a really pretty dewy look. The clear sunscreen leaves a strong white cast. Since I do re-apply often, the white cast becomes very obvious on my olive skin. It also becomes flakey by the end of the day so I have white flakes all over my face. I've never noticed any flakes with the tinted version. Once I finish this bottle I will triple check that I order the correct version."," June 26, 2019"

114,Kei,4.0 out of 5 stars,Check your skincare routine or you could regret it!,"  So, I don’t doubt that this is a GREAT sunscreen. However (and this is partially my fault) it should be noted (especially in the title of the product) that this has Niacinamide in it! Now that’s great if you don’t have a skincare routine that conflicts with that. But, I do and I’m really really glad that I had done a simple break routine of just Calendula serum and moisturizer because if I had used any of my Direct Acids or Vitamin C serums I would’ve surely regretted it! Please double check your routine before adding this sunscreen into it!!"," March 18, 2021"
115,Kema,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use daily and love it,"  Easy to spread into skin. Doesn't leave a white cast. I use about two pumps for my face and neck. My skin does look oily right after, but it starts to sink in after 10-15 minutes. I don't wear foundation, just cover with some translucent powder and I'm good to go.Didn't make me break put either which is amazing. One bottle lasted me just over 3 months using almost everyday."," June 1, 2021"
116,Dylan,2.0 out of 5 stars,So much pilling at a premium price point.,"  I want to start off my review by saying I really tried to like this sunscreen and make it work. Unfortunately, every time I applied it the sunscreen would start pilling and balling up on my face. Additionally, some days it seemed to set up just fine, but as soon as I came across a mirror I could see the white flakes of the sunscreen pilling up on my face and neck yet again.A lot people claim to love this sunscreen. I have to come to the conclusion that those people simply aren't applying a generous amount. A lot of youtube reviews of this product show the reviewers applying one tiny pump to the entire face, ears and neck, so of course it looks invisible to them because they barely have any on. The problem with that is that sunscreen is a dose-dependent medication. If one only applies a thin amount, they likely are getting anywhere from 1/2 to 1/5 of the labelled factor. At that point, you end up paying hundreds of dollars for sunscreen while your risk for skin cancers continues to increase due to insufficient protection.EltaMD does make great sunscreens, the UV Elements and UV Physical come to mind. The elements is more moisturizing and the physical is more matte. The UV Clear, however, just doesn't come up as being worth the premium price tag. I hope that they can find a way to solve the pilling issues with this formula."," June 3, 2021"
117,Shanice Ramos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bomb!,"  I love this sunscreen so much! I have extremely sensitive skin due to Differin and prescription Azelaic Acid. Literally everything burns. I was using Supergoop for months prior to starting the acne treatments, but once my skin became as sensitive as it is right now, Supergoop would burn. The only 2 things I use now are Vanicream moisturizing lotion and this EltaMD sunscreen. This sunscreen goes on smoothly, does not have that overpowering sunscreen scent, and does not leave a white cast. Love! I will use forever."," March 3, 2021"
118,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen with lots of UVB protection!,"  My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me - I have some sun damage (I admit, I haven't been very diligent with sunscreen - ever), and she explained to me that a sunscreen that protects against UVB rays is what is going to prevent sun damage/aging. Most sunscreens that you buy at the drugstore have either only UVA protection, or very little UVB protect. This product has a very high level of UVB protection, so she recommends it to prevent further sun damage - aka brown spots. I decided to try it and I love the consistency. I love that it is good for acne prone skin, so it doesn't make me oily or break out. I've been using a prescription bleaching cream to get rid of the current brown spots, along with this sunscreen, on a daily basis. My skin looks better than its ever looked before. I will continue using this sunscreen to make sure my skin stay looking this good."," March 18, 2018"
119,Sunny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally - a mineral sunscreen that doesn't leave me looking like a ghost,  I've tried dozens of mineral sunscreens that claim they won't leave a white cast (lies!).  I finally landed on this one.  This Elta MD face sunscreen goes on smoothly.  Doesn't feel oily or thick.  I love it.  I'm 45 with combination skin (oily T-zone).  I put it on in the morning and reapply halfway through the day.  My face loves it. Would highly recommend.," October 22, 2021"
120,KAREN BACON,1.0 out of 5 stars,BAD reaction like others mentioned! Beware if you have sensitive skin!,"  Yikes! I saw the other reviews saying that people broke out in rashes, or had a burning feeling from this product. I wish I hadn’t ignored it. I used it yesterday for the first time. By the time I wash my face in the evening, I could tell my face was all red. I woke up this morning to a rash all over my face, swollen eyelids, and just overall irritation. This will be going straight back where it came from!!"," March 8, 2021"
121,Nicholas Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only face sunscreen that doesn't give me mad break outs,"  Background on my skin type: I have extremely dry skin that is VERY prone to breaking out due to sugary/greasy food intake and sunscreen (not really due to period or dehydration). Also, I don't use this every day. I apply a tinted BB creme with SPF 30 (Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream) for make up days. I use Elta sunscreen when I'm being active like on the beach or hiking, or when I just decide not to wear make up.This has been THE ONLY face sunscreen I have used that doesn't give me spots. It's very shiny, so I usually put some translucent powder over it, so it doesn't look like I'm super sweaty (dewy look isn't my preference).I looked into getting some other sunscreens that were cheaper but still wouldn't clog my pores, but I didn't really find any adequate substitute for this product. I think it is worth it, because it will last for quite a while. It doesn't even take a full pump to spread evenly across my face (I have a normal sized face)."," August 15, 2019"
122,Elaine Bohman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Allergic reaction when exposed to sun,  I used it sporadically for a while and I would wash it off later since I felt like it was drying my skin. So decided to put it to the test by applying and running (with a hat on) in hot weather after work. (I usually run home from work but use a cheaper brand) I had a severe allergic reaction with redness and hives on my face. It took about a week to clear up with a prescription medication.  I really don't have sensitive skin and have used many different brands of sunscreen. I don't recommend this product especially if you have sensitive skin.," July 13, 2021"
123,SCCarrie,5.0 out of 5 stars,A god-send for people with rosacea,"  If you suffer from rosacea and break out with typical sunscreens when you are in the sun, this is the product for you.  My dermatologist gave me a sample and I loved it and ordered a bottle from Amazon.  It's the only sunscreen I have been able to use without breaking out, and I live in SC where the sun shines nearly daily.  It's light, goes on easily, and doesn't take much more than a dab to cover the acne prone areas of my face.  It's expensive, but you only need a little, and to not break out, it's worth the price.  It is basically zinc oxide (the old white stuff that life guards used), so it blocks out a lot of sun.  Highly recommend.  I've bought one extra bottle for my travel bag to make sure I'm never without it.  I cover the rest of my body with an SPF 30 and use this only on my face."," May 28, 2018"
124,Mary T,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for sensitive skin!!,  This is not for sensitive skin. I had an allergic reaction to this sunscreen. I used this and another tinted sunscreen on different days but the formulations were similar with only two active ingredients zinc oxide and Octinoxate. Be aware that this is a combination sunscreen and contains a chemical filter. Octinoxate is probably the culprit in both sunscreens that made my face break out in a horrible rash that hasn’t gone away (despite the fact that I stopped using both products) after several days. Octinoxate is a derivative of cinnamate that can cause allergic reactions in some people. If you have sensitive skin it’s probably best to stick to an all mineral sunscreen.," October 22, 2020"
125,Angela,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me - Sensitive Skin,"  I've tried using this product 2-3 different times now and I think I've given up on it. I'm kind of sad because of how many people like it and I know my Mother in Law uses it - so maybe i'll give her my bottle. But after trying to use it 2-3 different times for 2 days each I've had to stop each time. Some ingredient in it must be affecting my skin and it dries it out, makes my skin more sensitive, my face/neck start to feel itchy, I have a burning sensation when I put it on, and now I'm peeling more because it's dried my skin out - or has given me contact dermatitis. It was recommended by my dermatologist as I told her I have really sensitive skin and any a lot of things will break me out or dry out my skin like crazy. For those that it does work for no offense to you - It does has a nice feel to it, but kind of greasy when put on the skin and I do notice it leaves a white cast on your face if you're not light skinned. I'm between light and medium toned and I can see a white cast."," September 11, 2020"
126,KASI GIBBS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect sunscreen for your face!!,"  Best sunscreen I’ve ever used on my face!! I typically get so broken out from wearing sunscreen on my face. Small under the skin bumps, random giant bumps, you name it, I’d get it. I’ve tried all sorts of brands. I just spent 7 days at the beach applying this 2 or 3 times a day and I’ve had absolutely no breakouts. It doesn’t feel heavy or oily. I absolutely love it!!"," July 25, 2020"
127,Kasey,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is legit,"  I have avoided implementing a separate SPF product in my regimen for literally... ever. I hate the smell and feel of sunscreen on my skin. I have quite combo-oily skin and every other SPF product I've tried has only made me feel more greasy. Not this stuff. The texture is nothing like what I would expect from a sunscreen. It just feels like a normal moisturizer. It doesn't smell like sunscreen, really, either. I don't find that I get more oily during the day. On the contrary, I'd venture to say it might even help control my oil better than my normal routine alone. What really kind of shocked me is that it makes enough of a difference that when I forget to put it on before I put my makeup on, I sometimes remove the makeup and redo my whole skin care routine just to incorporate it, I like it that much."," February 22, 2019"
128,Mary,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not sure what the hype is about...,"  I'm in the process of finding my perfect daily sunscreen. This product comes highly recommended by some youtube dermatologists, and not so much by others. Both my SO and I didn't like it at all, found it drying and reactive on our skin. I have dry sensitive skin and he has normal skin. It smells a little funky, that's fine. It also pilled terribly with my other morning products: toner, vitamin c, moisturizer. So it's not for us.After using this I'm sticking with my supergoop products, love them all. My SO likes sun bum mineral."," May 25, 2021"
129,Jess,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for my sensitive skin,"  I should have read more reviews. I’m not returning it, I’m using it on my arms, but WOW did this cause chemical burns. Patches on my face are red and bumpy still, and my eyelid near my brow bone totally peeled off. Not sure if this is due to tretinoin or general sensitivity but please be careful."," January 19, 2022"

131,PeachyDeez,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but expensive $$,"  I really do like this sunscreen but paying almost $40 for it is a little ridiculous... I did use the entire bottle and was in need of another... but the price is just too high.. So I went back to my go to , the one that starts with a C... I used this during/after accutane and I never broke out... it’s a moisturizing sunscreen and has the same skin glowing blurring effect as the Elta MD Clear at more than 1/2 the price... so if you are looking for something similar to the Elta MD Clear but don’t want to pay$$$... try the one that starts with a C ...."," June 17, 2020"
132,ncshopper,1.0 out of 5 stars,Something is very different,"  I have been using Elta, MD products since 2015, buying them via Amazon since 2016.  This one is very different in a very negative way.  It has a chemical smell and it stings my eyes when I first apply it.  It also runs into my eyes and mouth after 2 hours of wear.  I have not experienced anything like this before.  I did contact the company via phone and was promised a return call, but that never happened.  I cannot use this on my face and can longer  recommend the product."," July 21, 2020"
133,Rachael,1.0 out of 5 stars,Yellow formula.,"  Third bottle,  first time yellow. Well within expiration. Past the 3 month return, because I buy it in advance, to make sure I never run out. Will be buying from local dermatologist instead to avoid."," October 18, 2021"
134,M. Long,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sunscreen for Acne-Prone Skin,"  I used this every day for about 2 months on my face and neck. I put it on under my skincare and under my makeup. It comes in a small plastic bottle with a pump. It comes out as a thick white liquid, about the consistency of a moisturizer.This is what I can share about the product.Pros:- Does what it is made to do.- Light scent, not overpowering sunscreen smell. Still scented though.- Does not leave skin oily.- Does not cause breakouts for acne-prone skin.- Does not cause makeup to come off, as it does not dry down to be oily.Cons:- The amount of product you get versus the amount of product you get. The bottle is quite small.- It does have a very very slight white cast to it. So if you have darker skin, and you will not be wearing makeup, it may be noticeable."," April 21, 2018"
135,Melissa,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good choice,"  While this sunscreen didn't become my Holy Grail, it is still a very good product and the best sunscreen I've tried so far. It has great ingredients - niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, lactic acid. It doesn't cause breakouts or make my skin greasy, and I have noticed that my mineral powder lasts longer if I apply it after this sunscreen. That said, the product has a couple of drawbacks. Many reviewers said it has a lightweight formula, but it still feels heavy on my skin. I also dislike the strong chemical smell, though I nearly got used to it already. To add, there is a need to use a moisturizer under this sunscreen, otherwise my cheeks will be all flaky after a couple of days. My skin is more on the sensitive side, and I am not a hundred percent comfortable with this sunscreen, but I would still recommend it, especially for those with oily/combo skin types."," November 9, 2018"
136,SpencerCat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a mineral sunscreen,  Why is this listed as a mineral sunscreen? It has octinoxate which is a chemical sunscreen.  They need to update the description and ingredients on Amazon as I don't see this mentioned anywhere.  I'm allergic to chemical sunscreens so this one is getting returned.," February 16, 2021"
137,Anchorbales,3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sunscreen but Priced Too High for Very Little Product,"  I have rosacea and so I have used gazillions of facial sunscreens.  This is a good sunscreen in that it was absorbed into my skin fast and nearly invisible compared to other sunscreens.  I always wait five minutes and apply another layer of sunscreen. I believe for the amount of sunscreen you get in the bottle is way too tiny for the price.  When I first glanced at the product bottle it looked bigger than what it was and not on the scale of other products its size.  It is pretty much the price for the product, but it is a good product and I can tell from how red my face is even with sunscreen on.  I am retired and live on 1/3 of the income I had when I was working, so, the price it too hefty in my opinion.  Blue Lizard and Daylong are reasonably priced.  If it wasn't for the cost difference and quantity of this product, I would buy it again."," July 30, 2018"
138,MRP,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not clear but works!,  I was reluctant to try yet another sunscreen that says it helps with oily skin yet still feels greasy but here I am. I have been using it for about a month and at the beginning what caught my attention was that it was advertised as a clear sunscreen with “NO WHITE CAST”. Well it definitely leaves a white cast that absorbs into the skin way later. Makes my face look a lot lighter and I’m an olive tone. Overall after using I kinda got used to it and do prefer it because it keeps the oiliness at bay more so than other sunscreens.," October 14, 2021"
139,naturaldog,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bit of a white cast.,"  Really great for sensitive skin and for post-prescription retinoid skin, if you've overdone it.  No scent, feels good, spreads well. Does not sting eyes.  I will continue to buy it and use it on my ""sensitive skin"" days, and on days when dust or pollen is irritating my eyes.  I end up using it a couple times a week, or patting it around my eyes during allergy season, but I wish it didn't leave a small but noticeable white cast.  Expensive, but I haven't found a less expensive dupe.  This is good to have in your skin arsenal if your skin is sometimes or always sensitive to other sunscreens.  Ditto for sensitive eyes."," April 18, 2021"
140,Lynch,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous Sunscreen - Too small of bottle,"  I'm giving this five stars because it really IS amazing sunscreen.  I've suffered from breakouts my whole live until I tried Elta MD products; I am forever grateful that I can finally wear sunscreen to work every day.  However, this bottle is tiny!  I couldn't believe I didn't read closely enough to see that I was ordering - 1.7 oz.  Holy Moly!  There is no need to pay this price for such a small bottle.  I usually get the tinted cream in the 3 oz squeeze tube for less, or the gigantic pump bottle for a similar price.  In my experience the spf 46 isn't any better than another, just make sure you are getting chemical free - good for acne prone skin.  There are so many good ones - next time I'll be more careful to see what is on sale :)."," January 6, 2019"
141,Catherine Yu,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received old product???,"  I bought this because of the great reviews and I’m trying to find a face sunscreen that works well with my skin type. I like the product, but I think this item I received might be old? I put it on and it’s clear and doesn’t have the SPF smell, which is great, but when the lotion dries, it leaves little white crusties on my face (looks like eraser dust). Is this product I received old? Can it be replaced?"," May 20, 2020"
142,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Caused breakouts,"  My dermo recommended this to me as I have developed acne due to a IUD and have oily acne prone skin to being with. This did not work for me at all. I had a hard time believing it was my sunscreen causing the acne but as soon as I stopped using this product my skin cleared, got less red, and was so much more moisturized. Also the product made my face so slick and oily. Just crazy. I switched to La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin for acne prone skin and it made a world of difference in clarity and the oiliness of my face. I know this product works for a lot of folks but it was certainly not for me. Giving it 2 stars as the product did do an awesome job of sun protection so it was a bummer I had an overall bad reaction."," August 11, 2021"

144,Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Non greasy,"  This sunscreen is amazing. I have used many sunscreen, especially before makeup. This is excellent in that it does not get sticky or greasy, really absorbs and feels like a serum. It does have niacinamide in it so helps with hyperpigmentation and to smooth the skin as well as providing protection from UV rays. This is my third bottle and o will continue to pay for it. The only negative for me is the price, would love for this to be about 20 dollars but honestly I am willing to pay for for it because it really is an excellent product"," May 25, 2021"
145,Maggie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do your face a favor and DON'T BUY this!!!!,"  I bought this because it was recommended for acne prone skin, however after a single day of using it as directed I have been left with the worst sunburnt face I have ever had. I rather have acne than this sunburn. I had previously been using a very expensive face sunscreen with SPF 30 but would get breakouts after using it so I did some research and read about this one that was supposedly good for acne prone skin. I thought it was a bonus because it was a higher SPF. After applying liberally and going outside for an hour I came in and had a bright red forehead and nose. This has done more damage to my face than I could have imagined. I'm disappointed that so many outlets would recommend such a horrible product. Do yourself a favor and your skin a favor and don't buy this!!!!"," May 24, 2020"
146,Nat Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Soothes and protects my combination, acneic skin","  I wanted to find a moisturizer/sunscreen combo to avoid putting two products on my fussy combination skin. The facial sunscreen I had felt like it just ""sat"" on top of my skin, feeling oily; the moisturizer I had only helped the dry patches of my face and flared up the acne in my T-zone. Ugh. Hoorah, this product solves both of those problems! After using it for a few weeks, I have noticed that my skin tone is more even, I have fewer breakouts, and my skin is softer. The lotion does not leave an oily feeling on my face. I live in the PNW so I haven't had many chances to observe its sunscreen abilities, but the 45 SPF is much better than the 15 SPF I had that left me feeling like an oil slick.One complaint: Elta MD, please put your product in a dispenser that is easier to reuse or recycle! If I'm going to use this product for the rest of my life, as I suspect I could, I would feel better not having to put each bottle in the trash. Please and thank you <3"," October 20, 2020"
147,BW,5.0 out of 5 stars,No old lady sun spots for me,"  I ordered this because it was suggested by an instagram influencer I follow. I needed something that would last all day since I don’t want my face and neck to be covered in tons of old lady sun spots in 15 years.She was right this sunscreen is perfect. I put it on everyday now! If I wear makeup, no big deal, I put this on first, and my makeup goes on just as easily right after. I’ll be ordering this again as well as looking into more of the eltaMD line!"," June 11, 2020"
148,Tyler,5.0 out of 5 stars,gentle enough while on Accutane,"  This was the first Elta MD product I've tried and I am satisfied! I bought this shortly after I started taking Accutane since my skin is extremely sensitive and I need lots of protection from the sun. It lasted me 4 months, allowing me 1-2 pumps a day. No burning or stinging! and my skin feels safe from the UV rays! I tried using cetaphil moisturizer with sunscreen when I ran out of this product and my skin was burning each time I applied, so I went ahead and purchased more Elta MD. It's pricier, but I trust it!!"," March 21, 2021"
149,Julie S.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Flakes and Pills, and Ridiculously Expensive","  I have used this sunscreen for a few months now, and although the texture of the lotion is light and non-greasy, and doesn't leave a white cast to the skin, if you don't rub it in *just so* you end up with sunscreen flakes and areas of pilling. I also found the price rather ridiculous for the amount of product received. I recently found an excellent sunscreen by Rejuvelle, with a much more elegant formula and a much better value. Sorry EltaMD, I won't be buying this product again."," November 13, 2018"
150,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Facial SPF I’ve Found,"  People should stop wasting money on facial sunscreen that’s too chalky, too sticky, too tacky, too irritating and too smelly. After tons of money wasted on bargain and expensive sunscreens, I’ve found my “it” spf.This is the best I’ve used when compared to grocery store brands, premiere brands, facial mist sunscreens, baby sunscreens, sunscreen powders, etc.I wanted a slightly moisturizing SPF I could wear over my morning facial serum and under my mineral makeup. I wanted to avoid any facial greasiness and an SPF that would prevent my light-coverage mineral makeup from setting. Additionally, I needed something that wouldn’t make me break out.Elta is the first and only brand I’ve found that delivers on all my wants."," July 10, 2019"
151,Michael Calizzi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional. Best SPF moisturizer money can buy.,"  My family has a history of Melanoma, so I wear spf every day to try to prevent it. This sunscreen is utterly exceptional and far better than any of the others I’ve tried. It has a higher spf than any other spf moisturizer I’ve used, and yet it does not make my skin appear white at all. It’s is extremely easy to rub into the face. Somehow, it seems to actually make my skin look better than before I put it on. It dosnt clog my pores at all, and it feels super nice and moisturizing on my skin. I feel super confident walking around outside everyday knowing that I am protected from the suns damaging rays. It is expensive, but even using it every day it lasts almost 2 months. It’s an insignificant price to pay for peace of mind that the sun isn’t damaging your skin every time you walk outside! IF YOURE ON THE FENCE BUY THIS NOW!"," December 14, 2020"
152,Allison,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only sunscreen I've found that works for sensitive skin and acne,"  I have tried a bunch of different sunscreens over the past few years. I have acne and I also have sensitive, combination skin. Yep, it's fun. The acne is genetic so I'm actually on a few skin treatments to keep my face clear. I have tried sunscreens ""designed for sensitive skin,"" (i.e. Aveeno) and I've tried sunscreens that are supposed to be ""really moisturizing"" (i.e. Neutrogena, etc.). Everything irritated my face. It was either really greasy or it made my face really red. As a young professional that really doesn't work. I had gotten this one from a Dermatologist in Spokane, Washington while I was in graduate school. It seemed too expensive and over the top. Well, I went back to using it recently and not only is it not horribly greasy (somewhat but tolerable), it doesn't irritate my face! I also don't break out, which is a HUGE plus for me. It's worth the money for me."," June 29, 2019"
153,Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the Best On the Market,"  Great sunscreen. Never bothers my eyes, good to avoid hyperpigmentation. Doesn’t look “white”. My only drawback is it looks too shiny-greasy. However, I’ve stopped wearing a moisturizer with it, that helps. It is s good moisturizer.  I usually use blotting paper after."," September 23, 2020"
154,kwap,1.0 out of 5 stars,“Sensitive skin” formula is very drying—makes my skin flake,"  Because of a rather involved basal cell surgery on my nose, I need a strong sun block for the scar. I’d been using the Neutrogena zinc product and it works well but it gives me a kabuki theater look. Very white and opaque. I don’t wear foundation, but I did discover that using some heavy blush over the top helps that effect—did that even when going to the beach. Anyway, thought I’d try this Elta product. It does leave a little bit of a white sheen, but not nearly as much as the Neutrogena. However, I think this formula—for sensitive, acne or rosacea prone skin—is not right for me. It makes my skin peel and flake—even on my chest it does that. I think that’s pretty strange for a sensitive skin formula. I’m willing to try a different one—perhaps a more moisturizing one, if that exists, but as it stands, I’d prefer kabuki face to flaky skin. Very disappointed."," July 10, 2019"
155,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,My absolute holy grail sunscreen for over 10 years,"  Just thought I'd leave a review because it's often hard for people of darker complexion like me to find a good sunscreen, this stuff goes on completely clear. No white cast. Also, with the niacinamide, it's really working to make your skin better and it's just a great one. A bit pricy but sun protection is important so I always splurge. 1 bottle lasts me ~3 months and I only use on my face."," December 2, 2020"
156,CAVALCANTE,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best I’ve ever purchased!,"  Honestly the product exceeded my expectations. I’ve been using it for few days now and it is awesome! I have pretty oily skin, and others Sunscreens would make my face even more oily which it’s bad for acne, but this one it’s awesome, if feels just like a cream and it blends very nicely, light weight! Which I love! And bc of that, after applying, it doesn’t spread around your face, like your eyes. Before I had problem with my sunscreen getting in my eye after applying and that’s definitely not a issue with this product! Because it is light weight and not oily, it makes it easier to do your make up too! Totally recommend it!"," February 23, 2022"
157,customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,PILLS BABY,"  Idk how effective it is at sun protection but everyone recommended this including dr dray. My personal derm recommended niacinamide for rosacea. I normally cannot use anything with heavy silicones or I break out in painful cysts. I thought this would be okay since the first silicone is volatile even though it’s the 2nd ingredient. It was easy to apply because of the silicones and didn’t leave a white cast. A couple hours after application it began to pill horribly! Which means in the areas it pilled, my skin was vulnerable to uv rays. I only put on moisturizer after it so it’s not like I had layers of product on top. Forget about layering makeup on top of this. By the end of the day I had several painful cysts and a smaller rash with bumps. I do not recommend this product, and it is way too expensive."," March 9, 2021"
158,Payton Cline,5.0 out of 5 stars,Repeat customer,"  Im a young adult female with skin prone to hormonal acne, and this is my go-to daily moisturizer & sunscreen. I’ve re-ordered 3 times in the past 1 year (aka this bottle lasts me about 4 months AND I keep going back to this product). The niacinamide and zinc keep my breakouts under control and are so smoothing. I use this product every day for sun protection paired with just the right amount of hydration for my oily, acne-prone skin."," July 11, 2020"
159,H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for sensitive, acne prone skin","  I've been using this sunscreen for about 3 years. I've tried other sunscreens during that time, some of them very pricey, but I always come back to this- I've gone through about 5 or 6 bottles. I have extremely sensitive skin that stings if I use chemical sunscreens. I'm also prone to acne, rosacea, and hyper-pigmentation so to find a sunscreen that's specifically designed to not aggravate those issues is amazing. It has no white cast, no scent, and works beautifully under makeup. It's not matte but it's not greasy- it feels and looks like a very lightweight lotion but it totally works at protecting my skin. Truly the best sunscreen I've ever used."," December 3, 2017"
160,Sensitive skin ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sensitive skin beware!,"  I would give it zero if I could. This product was mentioned in a few blog posts as recommended by dermatologists daily and the bottle even says for acne prone and rosacea prone skin. And there are so many glowing reviews.I thought it would be great for my sensitive skin. Within 12 hours of first application I had a mild rash, within 24 hours I had a full on reaction all over my face and neck.  Red raised bumps all over and itching.This may be a great product for some but something in it set my skin off in a way nothing ever has. So if your skin is sensitive don’t make my same mistake... test this product first on a small patch before slathering over your whole face."," May 27, 2019"
161,ParisSunset,5.0 out of 5 stars,*Does* have a lot # & Expiration Date,"  I love this UV Clear SPF 46 sunscreen. I use it on my face, neck, top of my chest, hands & wrists. It is not moisturizing, it’s dry but that’s how I want it to be. I love this shape too, and the 1.7oz bottle fits perfectly in my bag. This sunscreen lasts hours. It isn’t waterproof but it is sweat proof in my experience. Definitely recommend."," June 13, 2021"
162,Vilma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Using it for years,"  I have been using this product for years since my dermatologist first introduced it to me due to its strong sun protection with SPF 46. I later recommended to my friend who also purchased it after giving it a try during our trip to South America. The texture is really light and smooth, so you can apply foundation on it without feeling too heavy. Also I like the vacuum packaging for skin care products like this one."," January 8, 2021"
163,K. Hinds,3.0 out of 5 stars,Left my face stinging out in the heat and humidity,"  First off the good things: it goes on super smooth and doesn't leave a white tint behind. I have sensitive skin and use mineral sunscreen but have struggled to find one that doesn't leave me with a super white face. No burns after being outside for hours.However, I found that after being out in the heat and humidity this product left my face red with a stinging sensation. It may be because I am also being treated for acne, which likely makes my sensitive skin even more sensitive. I am going to stop using this product only because of the irritation, otherwise it deserves its high rating."," August 12, 2021"
164,Margarita,5.0 out of 5 stars,derm recommended,"  My dermatologist recommended this to me. I have combination skin - very oily in my forehead and around my nose but very dry everywhere else. I also am prone to acne scars and dark marks and my derm said this sunscreen is great for that type of skin because it contains zinc oxide. No complaints so far, I don't even wear foundation anymore! I feel comfortable just wearing this sunscreen and my skin has never looked healthier. And the bottle is small but it has lasted me over 5 months now even when I use it every day! So happy with this product."," May 16, 2020"
165,MizPurple,5.0 out of 5 stars,Confidence in the product,"  This is a new product for me and so far I’m really liking it. I have uber sensitive skin, but this isn’t causing any eye burning/tearing or rash/itching as most products do. It does the job of blocking out the sun and isn’t greasy. There is a slight white cast as is the case from zinc oxide, just give it a few minutes for the sunscreen to absorb before putting your foundation on. I was at my Dermatologist office and noticed they sell the exact product line, so that gives me some confidence in the product. If things continue along this trajectory, I’ll be purchasing the product again."," April 21, 2021"
166,Donna Campbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Goes on clear,"  So far I have yet to use an EltaMD product that I didn't love. I have acne prone skin and was recommended this product by my esthetician. I like to use this on days we are playing in the water since it does have some water resistance.  In the summer I generally only use their tinted sunscreen, so I haven't tried this sunscreen with makeup. But I can say that it is nicely moisturizing and does not leave any sort of white cast or greasy look."," August 10, 2021"
167,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosacea Approved,"  My sensitive skin with rosacea did not mind this sunscreen and it did not make me flare. It does come out white, but I don’t think there is a white cast (take that with a grain of salt as I am pale). It is moisturizing, but almost too much? If you have oily skin, it might take forever to sink in and go away, but it does for my combo skin. Just a little too dewy when first applied. Other than that, it’s great! Does have a smell that stays with you throughout the day, but it’s not too noticeable."," August 18, 2021"
168,shop girl,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wasn't impressed unfortunately,"  I bought this sunscreen after a long search for a great physical sunscreen for my face. Its got great reviews here & on YouTube. Unfortunately it did not work well with me. I'm not sure if its because I bought it on Amazon but I dont think I'll spend money on it again.1. You have to make sure to rub it in well or it'll leave white cast marks.2. Even when rubbing in well, after several hours I would check my face & I'd notice streaks of white close up.3. I only bought it to use on my face under makeup. When I'd go to rub in my primer or even just the foundation, the sunscreen would start to peel off.4. This particular one ( UV Clear) always leaves my skin feeling dry.Never got sunburned (so that's a plus) but wont buy again."," October 13, 2019"
169,Alina Barnett,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing product, low counterfeit rate","  This product is amazing. Since I started using it my occasional pimples (which a dermatologist told me were hormonal and unavoidable) are ~95% gone and the 5% remaining are smaller and heal faster. The slight redness on my cheeks and chin were not flush, but were from the sun and are now totally gone. I have very pale skin and don't have any issue with the whitish tint other customers mention.I have bought this product from Amazon for ~5 years, about 15 bottles total. Out of these, 2 had quality issues that made me suspect a counterfeit bottle. One bottle had a slightly different smell and color, but performed well. It may have been from a weird batch. The other bottle had a different smell which changed over time. It didn't provide the same skin benefits as the legitimate product."," January 28, 2020"
170,Lulu,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy!,"  I try to never write bad reviews unless absolutely necessary. This product made my skin burn so badly I could of cried & then I had deep cystic acne from it for days. It had such good reviews, I just don’t get it. I sometimes wonder if these companies buy their reviews because there is no way that many people love this product. I do have sensitive skin but nothing abnormal. I’ve tried several brands and never had such a poor reaction to a product."," July 26, 2021"
171,Kate,3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent face sunscreen with strong scent,"  Summary:An excellent face sunscreen, but unfortunately comes with a strong scent some may find off-putting. I will be returning this product and trying other facial sunscreen instead.Application:- Very easy to spread across the skin and dried down matte almost instantly, with little to no white cast (note: I am pale; your experience may vary based on skin tone)- Did not feel very moisturizing; I would use this over my regular moisturizer, but not in place of itScent:- Very strong scent, slightly sweet, almost fruity; kind of like cough syrup- Faded from notice after an hour, but was very distracting until then- If you are sensitive to scents, you may wish to sniff-test a sample in person at a local store, or return after ordering if it's too much"," December 8, 2020"
172,Alexandra Stull,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST SUNSCREEN I HAVE EVER USED.,"  I loved this product immediately when trying it. It sinks in really nicely and doesn’t leave a white cast at all. It does make my skin look a little dewy, but that’s a bonus for me! I love that look!! I have never gotten even remotely sunburned when using this product. The protection is great and I have noticed that it is also improving my acne, even my hormonal, cystic scars. I recently went to see a dermatologist and they asked me what products I used and she gasped when I told her that I use this product and she said “Oh my gosh! Good!! That’s the ONLY sunscreen I will recommend to my patients!!” Sooo that made me feel like I was doing something right. Heck yeah!!"," June 24, 2021"
173,EH,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Fine first time, now product breaking me out terribly on repurchase","  I purchased this once as it was recommended as a good sunscreen when prone to acne, it worked great and my skin loved it. I repurchased from this same seller as the first time and received the same product (i thought) but on first application it immediately broke me out. Either this is a counterfit product or the company suddenly reformulated and I just got into the new formula. Will be trashing and switching products cause who needs that drama..."," July 21, 2021"
174,Ramneet Kaur,2.0 out of 5 stars,Tough on eyes,"  This sunscreen gets rave reviews, but I figured out it was the source of my irritated eyes , even when I keep it away from my eyes."," July 19, 2021"
175,Marcia Karon,5.0 out of 5 stars,WORKS FOR ME,"  I can't scientifically prove that this works at the SPF that the package says, but I use it on my face and take a walk everyday and have not really tanned or developed the white spots on my face that I do have on my arms and legs, where I do not use sun block, because I want the Vitamin D. I not only use it as a sunblock, but also as a moisturizer. I chose it because it is uses zinc oxide instead of those chemicals that most sunblocks use, but it does not leave the white coating that most zinc oxide products so. I have been using it about a year and have it on subscription, every 2 months."," October 18, 2020"
176,VyVy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Made me breakout,"  Although this has a very light texture, like a whipped, airy cream, it made me break out. It seemed to not last long, and you need to reapply multiple times throughout the day.Pros: helped reduce redness around my nose and mouth; light, non-oily texture (seems a little too light though, so I reapplied quite often). I have dry skin, with an oily T-zone, but this did not make me more oily than usual.Cons: made me breakout, not with full-blown acne, but more of all-over bumpy skin as if it was a rash/acne that wanted to show itself. I used the product for a month, hoping my skin would get used to it. My skin texture/breakouts only improved when I stopped using the product, after 2 days.Overall, was looking for a substitute to my Shiseido that I have been using for over a decade. Unfortunately, this didn't cut it, so I am back to Shiseido, unless I can find a good/natural sunscreen."," May 14, 2016"
177,Garcia,2.0 out of 5 stars,Yellow cream,"  I’m disappointed that the sunscreen cream was yellow compared to the others I have previously bought. It’s not worth the price if you’re going to get a defective one. I really liked my previous ones with no defects but now thinking about trusting buying it here. So sad! :,("," January 19, 2022"
178,Scarlette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for My Acne-Prone Skin,"  I never write reviews but my love for this sunscreen compels me to. I have acne prone skin meaning that it not only breaks out with each new moisturizer and sunscreen I use, but with any change in the weather or my diet (I want to say it's oily...but then sometimes it's super dry). I started using this sunscreen over my skin-accepted light-weight moisturizer and I have seen SUCH a difference. My skin rarely breaks out now (knock on wood) and my skin actually has a glow to it. It's so lightweight that I barely know it's there - except when I touch my skin and am amazed at how soft it is - and it reduces redness in any unruly acne spot that inevitably shows up and even seems to help heal them faster. Further, my skin tends to dry out from using acne products (retin-a in particular) and this has helped keep my skin smooth and moisturized (in conjunction with my salicylic acid moisturizer) without any excess oils. Moral of the story for anyone with acne prone skin, I would definitely give this a try."," November 5, 2019"
179,Danielle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Been a go to for me since 2017,"  for reference i have acne prone skin with dry patches, rosacea, redness, pores, scars, hyperpigmentation, and im slightly sensitive. i break out normally on my chin and jaw as well as some areas on my neck and forehead. I’ve been using this for years. it’s the only SPF that doesn’t cling to dry patches, break me out, irritate my skin, clog my pores, and doesn’t give a white cast. sooo easy to blend into the skin, and so moisturizing but not heavy! makeup sits very nicely on top of it!! This is one of my favorite skin care products. i’ve rotated certain products throughout my skin care journey but this is a die hard for me.. i never had any problems purchasing it through amazon and will continue to do so."," March 11, 2022"
180,Charityforever,3.0 out of 5 stars,Why does it peel on my skin?,  I’ve gotten another bottle of this a couple years ago and am just writing a review since I tried it on again the other day. This product sometimes feels slightly burning and will (somewhat often)peel when I put it on my skin even with nothing underneath or over it in my skincare products. I noticed the first bottle would peel on my skin as well but I liked it so much I kept it and used it up. When I put a first layer on it peels sometimes. When reapplying it doesn’t peel but later on if I rub my face or apply more it peels at least a little. Not sure what this means? If it’s my skin not liking it or if the product is off (bad batch)? It’s a kind sunscreen otherwise.," March 1, 2020"
181,The Night King ,1.0 out of 5 stars,disappointing,"  I tried Eltas physical sunscreen and now this. I will say on a positive note, this one is easy to spread. but on my mediun brown skin, it left a white flaky residue on my face. my girlfriend has fair skin and she didn't have the same issue I did. just something to note depending on your skin tone. I will opt for a tinted sunscreen instead"," January 13, 2021"
182,Emma Sun,1.0 out of 5 stars,The color is yellow. The pump is broken,"  VERY DISAPPOINTED. Something is wrong with this batch. I don’t know if it’s expired or fake. First the color is yellow, not white like usual. Second the pump is broken so I have to break it. If I knew it was that bad, I would return it before breaking the pump. Third, I tried using it ONCE and my skin had so many red bumps. This is my 5th order. I never have any problem with this sunscreen before and this is the only sunscreen that works for my skin. Now I don’t even know if I should even order again"," March 2, 2022"
183,lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Necessity for acne prone skin,"  Was recommended to me by my derm, I have acne prone dry skin, I’m also very pale so spf isn’t something I can skip. I wear it under full coverage foundation, blends seamlessly no weird white shadow to it. Smells good, kinda like almonds? And also helps to stop any acne coming to the surface. The price isn’t great at first, but I understand why, it works."," April 7, 2021"
184,Cindy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this product!,"  I read the allure beauty review for this product and was sold.  I admit I was a little bit leery of purchasing this product on Amazon after reading all the negative reviews about fake product.  Went ahead anyway.  My product arrived yesterday and it had an expiration date both on box and product.  I used it for the first time this am and love it!!  The product is dewy, very light weight and spread easily without drag across my face & neck.  I found it has only a slight fragrance, which I don’t mind one bit.Very glad I bought this product.  I recommend anyone considering its purchase to go ahead without reservation."," April 11, 2019"
185,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as described,"  Does not make me feel like I am wearing sunscreen at all! Does not leave a white cast and goes on very easily. Do not need a lot to feel like it has covered your face completely. Also, I have very sensitive skin and it has not made me break out yet! I have been using it for about a month and it works great."," March 3, 2022"
186,Janna Yore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen I've ever used,"  Highly recommend this sunscreen. No strong smell, goes on like silk after other serums and moisturiser, and absorbs instantly. Slight sheen when done. It has niacinamide among other things, so it's nice to know it's doing things to improve your skin while wearing it. I don't wear makeup, so can't comment on layering it after skincare routine. I haven't singed my skin since using, and so far it's helped prevent hyperpigmentation. I am reordering!"," June 22, 2021"
187,Marie-Chantal Simard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my rosacea worst,"  I tried this product twice to protect me from sun damage and also prevent a rosacea trigger (sun).Everywhere I had put the cream (face, décolleté, back) I broke out in tiny little pimples at every pore in my skin. Like my skin tried to sweat but could not. The rash does not hurt, it is just unsightly.I tried the product another time (with no other product) to confirm, and I got the same rash."," August 18, 2021"
188,Lkimba75,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great SPF protection.,"  Recommended by my dermatologist. Wears well under makeup, as long as you let it set long enough (otherwise it may pill / flake). But no white-cast and is great for sensitive skin. It says something about acne, but I don't have any issues with acne and it works well with my combination skin."," April 24, 2020"
189,ACPC,3.0 out of 5 stars,It pills...,"  The formula doesn't sting your eyes, and it doesn't leave a white cast once you apply it. I want to love this product, but it has the major downside of pilling. If you accidentally brush your face or god forbid try to apply makeup on top of it, it starts coming off in little clumps."," September 24, 2021"
190,Eunice aviles,1.0 out of 5 stars,The other reviews ae rashes are REAL,"  Horrible, I usually always wear Korean sunscreen but decided heck, why not try this since we everyone hypes it up.....yes wrong choice, after I thought the other reviewers saying it gave them rashes and bumps might’ve just been their skin but NAH those reviews are real, my skin was so so beautiful unti BAM, this sunscreen gave me little bumps everywhere, not really pimples but little bumps like rashes:(, DONT buy this.... sad i lost $30 dollars but we live and learn... back to Korean sunscreen I go."," January 8, 2020"
191,Volanges,5.0 out of 5 stars,Invisible protection,"  I bought this daily-use sunscreen on the advice of my dermatologist.The cream pumps easily from the dispenser and applies smoothly without leaving a ghostly white residue. I also do not experience any sensitivity in my eyes.I have normal skin but I find that the sunscreen can dry my skin a little, so I apply a couple of drops of marula oil to my skin beforehand and then there is no dryness.I am very happy with this product - I went through an entire bottle in the spring and I am on my second bottle for summer - I don't think I have ever used a sunscreen as often as I use this one."," July 12, 2020"
192,Shannon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent,"  I have a very oily forehead that likes to keep a speckling of bumps at all times. I struggle with shine and weird texture in this area as well. So I am looking for a sunscreen that is very lightweight and minimizes shine. This one isn't bad, but it still leaves a pretty noticeable shine on my forehead (the rest of my face soaks it up nicely though). Overall, I'd say it's pretty decent. I'll keep using it, and maybe that Niacinamide in there will work some magic and reduce my oiliness over time... we'll see! I'll post an update if anything changes."," September 16, 2020"
193,Nancy Grace,4.0 out of 5 stars,Truly for oily skin,"  So many products claim to be mattifying or meant for oily skin, and I usually watch them slide off my face after a few hours. Not this. If you’ve been looking for a face spf that keeps your skin bone dry, this is it. The feeling was so uncomfortable that I ended up buying the version for normal-dry skin and just use this on my hands, as I refuse to return it simply for doing what it said it’d do.One star off because my skin was sensitive to it and I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone worth truly sensitive skin."," August 17, 2020"
194,hanbnan,5.0 out of 5 stars,love this,"  I never wore sunscreen regularly before this product; I've tried a bunch and they always seem thick or white or greasy or a variety of other gross sensations. This, however, just feels like a great moisturizer! I love the niacinamide and lactic acid additions - they keep my dry and sometimes irritable skin calm, smooth, and healthy. In the summer I use it as my moisturizer, on top of my serum and vitamin C cream, although in the winter I add a heartier moisturizer. I hardly ever repurchase beauty items (there are just so many to try!!) but I think this will be a staple in my routine."," May 20, 2021"
195,tealsimplicity,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, but very expensive","  Wow, this is the most glorious sunscreen that I've ever tried. It goes on as smooth as the moisturizer I use as part of my acne 3 step system and then disappears! I can then use my roll-on concealer with no problems at all. Why am I so excited about sunscreen? I develop acne and acne scars easily and sunscreen keeps the dark scars from getting darker due to sun exposure.I fear that it will be gone so quickly. As of now I use the slightest bit (2 pumps) on my face and neck and have retired my heavier sunscreens to cover my arms.I have medium brown skin and it disappears entirely. No longer do I look like one of the walking dead and even if I sweat it does not run down my face and burn my eyes. I ordered the water resistant sunscreen too and I'm excited to try it as well.I'll report back to let you all know how long it lasts. I may have to create a larger sunscreen budget, because so far I love using this product. I hate to fling around money willy nilly , but if a product works well it might be worth the extra dollars."," August 25, 2015"
196,Jm az,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mineral AND Chemical sunscreen,"  Description is VERY misleading... It says mineral 'based', but in addition to zinc oxide, it also contains Octinoxate 7.5%, which is a chemical sunscreen.  This info appears no where in this description as of May 2021."," June 2, 2021"

I have hormonal acne and it is under control now but I had a lot of red marks and scars and this is one of the only things that has helped with the discoloration and hyperpigmentation! I have only been using it for about 5 days and I already see a noticeable improvement! Some of my marks are close to being gone, I am so impressed with how well and how fast this product works! It also makes my skin feel so incredibly smooth throughout the whole entire day! It really is the number 1 sunscreen product that's for sure! I am so happy with this purchase and definitely going to stick with it, I cant wait to see how much more improvements I see next week! 10/10 recommend buying! I even got my sister hooked now!"," May 14, 2021"
198,Lucas Newman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great texture,  This is a super light weight formula for people who don’t like heavy textures on their skin!

Bc of its texture it sits nicely under makeup as well!," April 2, 2021"
199,LC98765,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen,"  This is wonderful sunscreen. Goes on really easily, doesn't have a funny smell, and is very moisturizing. I wish it weren't so expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for, and I have to say it's my favorite of all the sunscreens I've used so far. For reference, I have Fitzpatrick type 1 and the beginnings of rosacea, so I have to be really careful about sun exposure."," December 20, 2021"
200,pearl,1.0 out of 5 stars,This product causes dryness and wrinkles.,  I needed a new sunscreen so I started doing my research about the sunscreens in the market and I saw a lot of good reviews about this product. I ordered it and received the product and started using it right away. The main problem with this product is that it causes a lot of dryness around the eyes. I have an oily skin and I used an eye cream under the sunscreen but unfortunately it caused a lot of dryness around my eyes. The more time passes since you apply the cream the more it gets dry and starts showing wrinkles around the eyes that you didn’t have in the first place. I’m a dermatologist so I thought maybe the eye cream that I used is not that hydrating so I used a pomade like heavier eye cream underneath the sunscreen. But unfortunately this dryness persists. It causes progressive dryness and wrinkles around the eyes that makes you stop using it after 2 applications even when you use a very hydrating eye cream underneath. Very very disappointing. Unfortunately the time frame for return has passed and I can’t return it although I couldn’t use it even on my hands.," March 11, 2021"
201,Melissa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I really wanted to love this SPF, but...","  I reeeeally wanted to love this sunscreen. It was recommended by my esthetician, so I decided to purchase it. I was previously using the CeraVe Tinted Sunscreen, but wanted to switch to something that didn’t make me feel as oily. I first applied probably more than I should (two fingers worth) and I felt I had a white cast even though it promotes no white cast, so I slightly decrease the dosage, which I felt was okay. This past week, I feel like my forehead feels a bit bumpy/scaly, though you can’t see the bump. My skin has been feeling tight and dry, and I’ve started getting small dry patches around my cheeks. I looked up zinc oxide and it turns out it can be very drying to your skin depending on your skin type. In conclusion, this didn’t work for me. I’d also recommend not buying it through Amazon as it might be a counterfeit — that might have also been an issue."," March 28, 2021"
202,Jared S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen out there!!!,"  If you don't already know, Elta MD UV Clear is one of the best sunscreens on the market. It doesn't leave a white cast; it doesn't have a lotion texture; it doesn't give you acne breakouts.As for the authenticity here on Amazon... as long as the listing states it is sold and shipped by Amazon then you have nothing to worry about. It is completely legit. Lot numbers were clearly stated and a sufficient expiration was clearly stamped as well.If you want a quality sunscreen that doesn't feel like sunscreen then this is it!"," August 5, 2020"
203,Naomi Hughes,1.0 out of 5 stars,So many better options out there,  I got this because of all the positive reviews but I was really disappointed :( I have dry skin and this sunscreen made my face look too greasy for my preference. It feels like it would just rub off if I touched my face and takes a long time to dry down. I really don’t like the way any of my make up sits on top of it (even a small amount of power or concealer) it also tends to pill when I apply it unless I don’t use any other skin care products under it or I take time to pat it in carefully. It does have a high spf which is nice but the smell is the worst part of this product for me. It has that sunscreen smell which stays on my face for hours and I can smell it all day. Even on my fair skin tone I can see a slight white cast in certain lightings so my guess is that this won’t work for darker skin tones. In my opinion there are so many better/more cosmetically elegant/less sticky/less expensive options out there and I would not recommend this product.," April 16, 2021"
204,hblacet,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite sunscreen, and I have used many!!","  Edit... Amazon sent a reply right away. It was seamless. The prouct itself, I LOVE. It is the only sunscreen that I know won't break me out, calms the redness in my cheeks, and works. I never get burned when I wear this luxurious sunscreen... feels like I'm wearing nothing and makeup goes on smoothly. I exfoliate regularly so I burn easily, my cheeks especially since I have mild rosácea.My item never arrived. So I cannot review it,.and I cannot return for a refund! Trying to find a way to contact someone to make this right. Item not cheap."," May 28, 2020"
205,Hailey,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t recommend,"  This was my first time buying pricey sunscreen and I was super disappointed. I have mild sensitive skin. All sunscreen that I’ve used will make me break out if applied everyday. I was hoping this product would prevent that from happening, but it didn’t. Also, when I applied it to my cheeks, it burned pretty good. Aside from the breakouts and burning, the worst part was how dry it made my face. It took me over a month to get my face feeling back to normal.The only positive thing to say about the sunscreen is that it really absorbed into the skin and didn’t make my skin shiny and oily."," December 10, 2020"
206,mel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Use over moisturizer,"  I like this. It’s nice and easy to apply and doesn’t leave residue like some can. I use it over a moisturizer bc it’s not moisturizing for my normal to dry skin. Overall, feels good and protects."," December 1, 2021"

I found this product and my eyes and face are Thanking me! I've experienced Zero sensitivity if the product gets into my eyes And because my face is generally on the dry side I find that Elta MD also gives enough moisture Without that horrible sunscreens smell.It's definitely worth a try! I won't go to any other brand now that I've found something that works!"," June 4, 2020"

I actually put it in my water line of my eyes to see if it would start burning and it did not.I’m extremely sensitive to sunscreen, and many other cosmetic products however this did not burn me at all.I also have rosacea, this did not affect my rosacea in anyway.I would highly recommend this product."," August 2, 2021"

I went to the beach yesterday where my face was badly sunburned, despite reapplying many times. Amazon does not verify the authenticity of their products and is not an authorized reseller of Elta MD. Counterfeit beauty products are a major problem on this website. From now on I will purchase either from my dermatologist or directly from the Elta MD website only, and I recommend that you do the same."," August 16, 2020"

It felt like I had sunburn and I was only out of the house for 30 minutes that day. I'm sure it works for some people, but this was not for me. I am light skin and have very sensitive skin. I thought this product would work for me, but sadly it did not. It took 3 days for my skin to no longer burn when putting on moisturizers."," July 8, 2021"

Not exactly good for MY skin. Amazon allowed me to return the product."," August 20, 2021"
214,Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have always HATED applying sunscreen,"  I have fair skin, and my family has a long history of skin cancer.  My dermatologist implores me to wear sunscreen daily.  I don't want to get skin cancer; I don't care about being tan.  However, I have always HATED applying sunscreen.  I hate how it feels going on, it makes my makeup weird, it doesn't absorb, it makes me sweat, or some other similar problem.  Anyway, I looked online a fair amount after my last derm appointment, and thought I would give this one a shot.  I love it.  I don't have any of the problems that I just described.  It is very light weight and quick to absorb.  My skin is dry and a little sensitive, but I don't have trouble with dryness or irritation.  ON the other hand, it is not oily.  It just sort of disappears (within seconds).  I've only been using it for about a week, so I guess if something changes I'll come back to update.  In short, I know it's expensive, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling to find a daily sunscreen that they will actually use."," April 15, 2017"
215,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,I won’t leave home without it,"  I have sensitive and acne prone skin but work outside in Louisiana pretty much every day. I won’t leave the house without using this sunscreen and have yet to get a sunburn no matter how much I sweat. I have tried many different kinds of facial sunscreen from drugstore to high end and they all either make me break out, itch, are greasy, or can’t stand up to the sweating. One bottle lasts me about 11 months using it every single morning so don’t stress about the price tag. It’s worth every penny."," December 21, 2021"

I've tried everything that's supposed to be for sensitive skin, including fancy brands but they all make me break out whether its with dry patches, small bumps, or acne. This sunscreen absorbs quickly and does not leave a white cast on my face either, and sits well under makeup. I usually apply a 2nd layer after the first one dries for extra sun protection, and even with 2 layers I don't break out in eczema/bumps. After I wash my face at the end of the day, I can still feel the moisturized layer as it washes off. Love this stuff, and I hope this helps any customer looking for something for extra sensitive skin like mine."," June 10, 2021"

The skin on my face cannot take any type of fragrance or harsh chemicals because it burns, itches, and feels like fire ants are walking all over it.  I have tried ALL sorts of sunblock products and even the mildest ones left my skin feeling from uncomfortable to downright painful :(Eltamd has changed everything for me!  I didn't want to get my hopes up too high when I ordered this product because I'd been let down by so many other brands before.  Man, oh man.  I was incredibly relieved, surprised, and GRATEFUL to see/feel for myself that Eltamd does what is says!  It is calming on my skin (this has never happened with ANY other sunblock before!), COMPLETELY sheer, and has absolutely no strange smell whatsoever.  I was able to wear it under my mineral powder make-up and my face didn't look shiny or feel gunky AT ALL.I will continue buying this product for as long as it's made.

It has virtually no smell which I favor unlike suntan lotions that have that suntan lotion smell like you’ve been sitting by the pool.  This has none of that.  I wear it everyday.  No breakouts or other skin reactions. I’m on my fourth bottle and just bought two more one for home and one for my gym bag!

I have never gotten burned or even slightly red on my face or neck where I apply the Elta MD Clear. On my body, I use chemical sunscreen 50+ spf and have tan lines from my shoes and cycling gloves.I have a problem with my pores clogging. I have used Retin-A Micro in the past and every other sunscreen burned like the dickens when I applied it. The Elta MD Clear did not. Now, I just used Proactiv Plus as night and Elta MD Clear in the mornings. I recently went to see a PA about getting Botox for migraines. She commented on how nice my skin is. I just turned 30 and hardly every wear foundation (if I do it is Jane Iredale Pure Pressed Base).Elta MD Clear is a white cream but dries clear. It has not caused me to breakout or clog my pores. Since using just Elta MD Clear in the mornings and Proactiv Plus at night, my nose has actually unclogged A LOT. I usually buy 3 of these at a time because I never want to run out!"," April 6, 2016"

Unfortunately this irritated my face and neck terribly again, and I had to take medication to fight the urge of scratching myself. EltaMD sunscreen may work well for some people, but definitely not for me, or potentially other people with sensitive skin.

224,Linda Lou C,4.0 out of 5 stars,Has become part of my rotation,  At first I did not like this sunscreen at all and stopped using it. I recently gave it another try and now I like it much better. I originally thought this sunscreen was making me break out and since it is for sensitive skin I was unhappy about that. Then later I found out a food sensitivity was making me break out so I kept it to try again once my skin settled down. I am glad I did because it is not causing issues now. I took off a star because I do experience some redness in my cheeks when I have used it and l worry that will eventually cause more inflammation so I alternate it with my totally mineral sunscreens.," June 30, 2019"

She asked me what sunscreen i'd used and I told her i'd given up using sunscreen because it just made my acne worse and made my face look both ghostly white and shiny like a brand new coin.  I basically just wore wide brimmed hats wherever i went.  Anyway, the dermatologist gave me a sample of Elta MD and told me that she thought i would like it.  I tried it thinking it would be like all the others but was pleasantly surprised.  I immediately bought a bottle of it after finishing the sample.Elta MD Clear actually helps my acne! It's got niacinamide which apparently keeps acne under control.  It also doesn't leave such an obvious white film on my skin.  I have medium olive skin and most sunscreens leave me looking like i'm covered in chalk.  There is some shine and whiteness when first applying, but it becomes more transparent and matte in 20 minutes.

It is so light that I sometimes have a hard time believing it's really a sunscreen, since sunscreens are traditionally pretty heavy, goopy, and unpleasant. Usually the higher the SPF, the more viscous the sunscreen.  But this sunscreen is still lighter than most SPF 15 sunscreens out there--and it's SPF 46!I have sensitive/dry skin and this stuff has never irritated it. My sister is blessed with a more normal/oily complexion and this sunscreen works great for her as well.To top it all off, this sunscreen is paraben-free, oil-free, and has no added fragrance.  It doesn't have the harmful chemicals found in most other sunscreens.

I’m racially ambiguous with tan skin so I thought it would be easy to find a sunscreen with no white cast for me that hydrated and protected me from the sun and aging.

239,mamma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional !,"  Impressive sunscreen! worth the price! I really wasn't expecting much, but i'm so impressed I will def reorder. I like that its a pump, has minal smell and the white cast disappears very fast, in addition it leaves a matte finish that reminds me of a primer I once used. I'm using it with mac weight less foundation, no streaking or altering the color. I  I'm a usual neutrogena girl but have on other occasions, tried expensive but effective sunscreens, yet i never felt motivated to reorder them.  this is a winner, I can see why its so popular!"," October 25, 2019"
240,Ines,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,"  After trying one product after another this sunscreen has been the best this far. Both my teenagers and myself use it. It goes on easy and is quickly absorbed. If properly applied ZERO white residue on your face. Of course like any other good sunscreen it does require reapplication after 80 minutes.Best part, it doesn’t burn or run or irritate your face."," July 14, 2021"
241,Viviana AR,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caution: caused contact dermatitis,"  I wanted to love this product, and had high hopes based on all the positive reviews. The product applies like a dream,  spreads easily, is comfortable on the skin and leaves no white cast. It seemed like the perfect sunscreen until 2 days later when I developed a horrible skin rash all over my face, chest and neck where I applied the product. My skin in completely red, itchy and full of tiny bumps everywhere. I had to take an emergency trip to the urgency care because of the pain. Beware if you have sensitive skin! I recommend skinceutical’s physical spf 50, which I’ve used in the past without experiencing any allergic reactions."," September 5, 2021"
242,NoName,3.0 out of 5 stars,I use everyday....but it's kind of a hassle.,"  When I first reviewed this product, I said I didn't like it because it dried my skin out and didn't absorb well, so it was flaky and peely. I'm editing/rewriting my review because I gave it another shot and I use it every day  now -  but it's still a little tricky.What I mean is, I had to change other parts of my skincare routine to make this work. I can't use this over just any moisturizer - I had to give up my favorite moisturizer because I realized that the combo with this sunscreen was causing the flaking/peeling. After some experimenting, I found that I can only use a gel moisturizer (Clinique and Garnier both have them), and to combat the drying out (and to make up for the fact that my daytime moisturizer is lighter now), I started using a much heavier night cream. And, I can't explain this, but it seems like the flaking/peeling problem is worse the less of the sunscreen I use (for example, toward the bottom of my neck where my application is a bit lighter, I still get some peeling from time to time). It's a bit greasy - about what I would expect from any sunscreen, but worth noting because the description kind of sounds like it wouldn't be. I let it sink in as long as I can wait, and then right before I have to leave the house I have to put something else on to combat the greasiness, like a powder or a BB cream with primer.But I've made all these changes because I really do like what the sunscreen offers - high-ish SPF, broad spectrum, and transparent Zinc Oxide."," October 3, 2012"
243,E & C Michaels,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail Sunscreen,  My dermatologist recommended this to me after my skin reacted badly to several other brands of sunscreen. This is my holy grail sunscreen. I have very sensitive pale skin and this stuff is nothing short of a lifesaver. I am outside frequently during the day and have yet to burn. This formula is so sheer and light that I don't feel it at all once it has dried.  It has zero white cast and doesn't appear in photos with a flash. My wife says it also wears really well underneath makeup and doesn't cause pilling. The price is a little high for my taste but it is something I am happy to splurge on because of the high quality compared with other sunscreens.," May 11, 2018"
244,Mariaanna Riga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Did research on this sunscreen,  I did a lot of research on this sunscreen a lot of dermatologists recommended it and Kyle Richards had it on her LIVE and if uses it under her makeup.

246,AntheaMcQuoid,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Go To, HG Sunscreen","  This stuff is so protective and moisturizing.  It applies easily and is very hydrating.  I have very sensitive skin and I can break out easily with some sunscreens, so I was nervous the first time I used this.  But I have never had a reaction or a breakout from it, and this is now my third bottle.  I live in Florida and the sun and humidity is brutal - I find it protects really well. There have been days where its been a little too moisturizing (when we've had very high humidity) but generally it plays well in the heat, and on top of my usual skincare.  I don't experience piling with this, and although it initially leaves a white cast, it does absorb easily and disappears after a few seconds of applying.  I only use it on my face, and a dime sized amount seems to do the trick. So I find it lasts quite a while (I use drug store sunscreen on my body) but if you were tempted to use it on your body as well I can imagine it wouldn't last long. This really is my holy grail sunscreen!"," September 10, 2018"
247,samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for acne prone skin!!- (Using for 5 months),"  I usually never do reviews and i was very hesitant to buy this because of the price, and mostly i was scared it was going to break me out. I have very sensitive skin and have been dealing with horrible acne the past year. BUT it doesn't break me out!!! It actually moisturizes, doesn't leave that white film like other sunscreens & doesn't have strong sunscreen smell at all- I can barely even tell its sunscreen.I have combo skin, it is more dry in winter months and then more oily in summer due to humidity. Sometimes I'm in the middle, (normal) but that's pretty rare LOL.I have been using for 5 months everyday and I still have some left in my bottle. I LOVE this product & will be using for as long as I can."," February 5, 2019"
248,JK,1.0 out of 5 stars,Box opened and used,"  I bought this along with the tinted version and both came in boxes that were ripped, opened and looked like they were used due to the residue around the pump. It also smelt like it was expired despite specifically making sure I bought new products. I didn't want to risk putting on my face and want to return it, but I'm no longer in the States and can't. Sad waste of money. :("," January 27, 2020"
249,Micki D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really reduces red in your face.,"  I have been buying this through my doctors office. Now I can order it when needed and the price is comparable. This really reduces the red in my skin! However, if I put it under my eyes my eyes itch all day. Now I avoid the eye area and neck or I start scratching. On those areas I use a different sunscreen. I really love how it improves the look of my skin."," May 9, 2021"

251,DBrink,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin,"  This feels a  little greasy but it does not irritate my sensitive skin which is a huge bonus.  I tried samples from my dermatologist and was pleased so I decided to save myself a 30 min drive to their office to buy more and just get it on Amazon (same price both places).  What I failed to notice, and is the reason I gave only 3 stars, is that this is not waterproof or sweat-proof.  I don't like how greasy it feels for everyday use, but that's what this is for; I wanted it for daily walks year-round and for beach trips.  After several days at the beach putting on sunscreen, my skin gets red and bumpy and irritated.  This product did NOT do that when I tried the samples so I was excited to have found something that worked for me.  It's fine for winter, but when I start to sweat in warmer weather, I'm not protected.  This is my fault for not reading the label more closely, but a bummer to have spent so much money for something I can't use year-round."," August 16, 2020"
252,LJLW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go-to sunscreen,  I chose Elta MD because it is cruelty-free. I felt even better about my choice after hearing two nationally known dermatologists on a respected radio medical radio program state this is one of three sunscreens they recommend. I had used one of the brands they recommended but wanted to switch to a cruelty-free product.," September 17, 2021"
253,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Found the one!,"  I couldn't really ask for more from a sunscreen. I am 40 and have combination, sensitive, and acne-prone skin  (although curology has changed that last part)! This sunscreen is perfect for me. Zero white cast, moisturizing but doesn't cause a greasy t-zone, and the protection is great. I've tried countless SPF moisturizers and I will definitely stick with Elta MD. My only complaint is it is hard to tell how much product is left. The container is light and I'm always afraid I'm about to run out. Also, it's pricey, but definitely worth it for me!"," June 11, 2020"
254,Cecilia Montesinos Richter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Defective dispenser,"  This product is excellent, and my favorite, hands-down, which is why I continue to purchase it despite the flawed dispenser. I have purchased this three times on Amazon, and each time there comes a point when the sunscreen begins to leak out of a(n initially sealed) hole in the bottom. I simply store the dispenser upside down, and hold it upside down when I pump it out. It's still more convenient than dealing with driving to my very busy dermatologist's office to buy it there, but may be a dealbreaker for some of you."," March 24, 2020"
255,Julia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my sensitive skin,"  Great SPF for Rosacea.It does not eliminate the redness and does not reduce the breakouts, but it offers excellent daily SPF (SPF 46) protection and does not irritate the skin.The skin easily absorbs it. Feels very light, and stays on throughout the day.I apply it in the morning or before going outside, right after my moisturizer. I feel I can use it even without the moisturizer, as this product is very moisturizing.However, at the same time, it won't leave the skin looking oily. Absorbs fast, and great to be used as a foundation under the makeup."," April 9, 2019"

257,Personwhoreads,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Way over-priced, but I keep buying it because it's that good.","  I don't know about you, but sunscreen on my face can often make me break out or just feel itchy. This sunscreen doesn't do either. It smoothes on beautifully and disappears into the skin. No white cast that I notice. I love it. They have one that is tinted which is great too, but I tend to love this one more."," October 8, 2021"
258,MeatWad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for anyone with sensitive skin!,"  I am adult male and I have tried many different types of lotions that contain SPF and all of the lotions I have tried tends to block my pores and I eventually break out even more. I have a combination of oily and dry skin around my face. This is the only SPF lotion that I have tried and currently using. I have been using this for approximately two years now and I purchase via Amazon because I can not find it at the local store. But this stuff is like god send, very light application, does not clog my pores and does it's purpose by helping moisturize and block my face from the sun's ray. Thanks EltaMD, please keep to continue to manufacture this product! Just wish the price was lower.  =)"," November 27, 2017"
259,Reilly Reinhold,5.0 out of 5 stars,My skin is in LOVE,"  I LOVE this sunscreen! For years I had smooth, hydrated skin but about 6 months ago I was randomly slammed with persistent hormonal acne including cysts and tons of under-the-skin whiteheads. I had to revamp my whole skin care regiment and my dermatologist recommended adding this sunscreen to it. It’s lightweight and DOES minimize redness of inflamed acne. My face is still oily in the Florida heat but this product helps to manage it. While in this horrible skin flare-up my skin has been ultra sensitive but it welcomed Elta MD so I will keep using this sunscreen as long as I can afford it."," June 13, 2020"
260,Nathalie D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing,"  I love EltaMD products. I sometimes work in a dermatology office and they offered these at the counter for people to purchase. They gave me some products to trial and I’ve been using it ever since. Of course, make sure you get the real product not from individual sellers... The one I got was real and it works just like the one from the doctor’s office. I also use the AM and PM therapy serums. Works wonders for my face and neck!"," April 23, 2021"
261,Mel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for daily use (not water resistant),"  This is everything I never knew I always needed in a sunscreen. 😁 Seriously though, after trying and hating almost ever facial sunscreen I’ve tried from Neutrogena to Tatcha to Glossier to many other brands, I have finally found a daily sunscreen (for the face) that doesn’t make me go “yuck” when I apply and wear it. It’s a light formula with almost nil cast. Finally no more greasy or heavy feeling.  Full disclosure, it’s not water or sweat proof so use something else while working out or going to the beach."," December 31, 2018"
262,Lay L.,2.0 out of 5 stars,product pilled up,"  Out of many sunscreen with Zinc oxide, this is one of them that don’t leave my skin with white cast (most of them do).It is easy to apply. You can’t even tell I have sunscreen on my face. It still stung my eyes when the sweat drip from my forehead into my eyes........but it is not nearly as bad as all the other sunscreen that i’ve tried.I don’t like how small of a bottle it came in for the price. Therefore, I will not be repurchasing this item.Update: this product does not play well with my face cream (or any cream at all if it was applied before the sunscreen). It will pilled up. I will not be repurchasing this sunscreen."," November 27, 2019"

I have redness around my nose and cheeks with acne marks and brown spots. This is the first spf  I've used that doesn't break me out or makes me look shiny or greasy.I had the laser matrix done which has help in brightening my skin. I started using this to keep my face from becoming dull.This evens out my skin tone...somehow calms the redness and makes my face look flawless. No shiny no white cast. Even in photos my skin looks awesome. It doesn't have tint but somehow this spf makes my skin glow. I don't wear any powder or makeup anymore because of this. My skin feels nice and with a velvety look and feel not matte.I 100% recommend.Also when I wear this my blush stays put for the whole day at least 13 hrs.Love it!"," February 16, 2016"
266,Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good sensitive skin friendly sunscreen.,"  First off let me say you need to wear sunscreen!! And reapply throughout the day if you want your sunscreen to be affective. This sunscreen is a great physical sunscreen. It does leave a white cast and it balls up if you rub or put makeup on over it. It does not break me out or irritate my skin. It is really gentle and slightly drying on my skin at least. It has a light texture and no fragrance. It has a slight sunscreen smell but I got used to it and it does not bother me at all. It is on the pricey side for the size of the bottle, but I think it is worth it if you are looking for one of the best physical sunscreens in the US."," January 19, 2019"

It doesn't feel greasy, it doesn't leave any white residue, it doesn't cause me to breakout, and it goes on great under my other products. Would definitely recommend. Only con is that it's expensive"," April 14, 2020"
268,LucianDoll,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t burn!,"  This was good and didn’t burn my skin while using tretinoin! Yay!Update:This has been one of the best sunscreens that I have ever used. With dark African-American skin, it does leave a bit of a white cast when put on. It does also sting a bit, but I think it’s from the niacinimide in it. It is also a bit greasy, but for me that’s not too big of a problem. I would recommend it over neutrogena products and if it’s too expensive look into PURITO sunscreens here on Amazon. Make sure the seller is PURITOKOREA."," October 25, 2019"

271,FormerZonie,4.0 out of 5 stars,I just wish this was a water-resistant product!,"  If this product was water-resistant, I would give it 5 out of 5 stars.  I have really sensitive skin and break out easily from sunscreen and most moisturizers.  This sunscreen (although, I've only used it twice) seems perfect for my face.  But, it really doesn't do me any good if I plan to go in the hot sun.  This sunscreen is NOT water resistant and will not provide coverage if you sweat or get wet :-(  I don't believe they make a facial sunscreen for acne prone skin that is water-resistant, which is very disappointing.  Perhaps it is the water-resistant ingredient that irritates acne prone skin.  Who knows?  I guess if you use a daily sunscreen for running errands, etc. this is worth the expense. Unfortunately, I work from home and really only wear sunscreen when I'm hiking or by the pool.  Prior to finding this sunscreen, I used Elta MD's UV Physical Broad-Spectrum SPF 41 Sensitive Skin facial sunscreen (purchased from my dermatologist).  That is an awesome product and goes on like a concealer or foundation, but makes my skin breakout.  Needless to say, my facial sunscreen search continues...."," April 5, 2014"

275,sd2014,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen out there!,"  I absolutely love this sunscreen for the face.  I will never use another face sunscreen again!  My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for me since I have oily, acne prone skin and I love it cause it doesn't cause acne or make it worse.  The sunscreen has 5% niacinamide which is shown in studies to help heal acne/hyperpigmentation after acne.  It may cause a little redness at first but this goes away after a few minutes.  I have also noticed it may appear greasy/shinny/maybe a little white cast at first but once it soaks into the skin it is clear. I always dust a little powder on my face to take care of any shine and to even out my skin tone cause I can't go makeup free.  It feels light, not heavy like other sunscreens.  For some these factors may be deal breakers as some may seek matte finish sunscreens but the benefits of this sunscreen are worth it.  It's fragrance-free, oil-free, paraben-free, non-comedogenic, and perfect for sensitive skin/acne prone skin.Sunscreen is so important and especially if you don't want any hyperpigmentation getting darker.  I am on tretnoin (retin-a) so sunscreen is a must!Buy it, try it, and I doubt you will be disappointed."," October 5, 2013"
276,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me.,"  Once I used this product, I broke out worse than I was before using. I have pretty bad acne in my 30’s and just use tea tree oil and retinol to treat with fairly good luck. Every time I use this within a few days I get a flare up on my chin, cheeks, and jaw line. Used several times in the past year and the result is the same every time so I know it’s not a fluke."," April 28, 2020"
277,Porgy,2.0 out of 5 stars,Test it first for an allergic reaction.,"  I use the Elta MD UV Daily 40 SPF, without any problems,  but I thought I would try this one because of the higher SPF. I tried it yesterday - having run out of 40SPF. I broke out in a red kind of rash,  and today still have lingering  slight redness. , .  Not terrible, but enough to think I should have used this  product within the return period to test it.  MY advice with  this, any product is to test it right away even if you don't plan on using it right away. Buying this turned out to be a waste of money.  Will either go back to Elta MD SPF daily 40 , or see what other manufacturers have."," February 18, 2018"
278,Warisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"  This is amazing!! I have very acne prone skin & currently going through acne. And whenever I put this sunscreen on, my skin feels so nice.

Worth every $$."," May 18, 2021"
279,Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Go-To Favorite Sunscreen for everyday/ under makeup,"  LOVE.  This is the only facial sunscreen that doesn't make me break out.  I'm on my second bottle.  It leaves a nice glow to my combination skin, but doesn't turn me into an oil slick.  It also has a slight ""luminescence"" to it that I like; I feel like it subtly enhances my complexion.  I'll buy this again for my sensitive acne-prone skin, and I'd definitely recommend it to a friend!"," August 13, 2015"
280,Dana,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best for sensitive skin,"  There is a reason why this sunscreen is so highly recommended for sensitive skin. I have oily/combo skin and find that this applies smoothly and while not particularly moisturizing, it doesn’t make my skin feel tight or dry over the course of the day. It is also one of few sunscreens that have not felt irritating/contributed to breakouts. Have not had any issues purchasing (& one repurchase) through Amazon as the product quality has been consistent for me and Amazon is an authorized reseller according to the manufacturer (unlike a popular online Derm focused website, which is surprisingly on the manufacturer’s unauthorized reseller list)."," December 7, 2019"
281,M. Nealis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!,"  I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading the reviews, but I love the brand so I tried it out. I should have listened... I put it on my face and noticed a few hour later some little bumps, didn’t think twice.Then I wanted to see if it was the lotion so I put it on the bottom half of my face - as shown.The bottle has a lot # and expiration date so I don’t know what happened.My bottom half of my face was so hot, burning and obviously is was because of the cream !So please do not buy this cream unless from a dermatologist or directly from the brand website."," April 10, 2020"

283,Shelby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleared my skin,"  Who gets excited about a sunscreen? I bought this as it was recommended by my esthetician. I have been on vacation in Mexico for 3 days and have been applying/reapplying consistently. No joke, this has not only protected my skin, but also cleared it! I usually have troubles with hormonal acne. Since using this product, I have seen a great improvement in my skin. I would recommend this product for acne prone skin."," August 14, 2021"

287,Rachel Cohen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the tinted one!,"  I bought this sunscreen and the tinted one, and although they are very similar, I prefer this one. The tinted one doesn't give as much coverage as I would have liked. The formula is so lightweight and moisturizing. It feels as if there is literally nothing on your skin. No white-tint at all either. 10/10 Recomended."," June 16, 2021"
288,Liz T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best and safest sun protection product I've ever tried,"  I found this gem on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website. Do you know how hard it is to find a skin product that is safe from dangerous chemicals, gentle on sensitive skin, and that despite all this-still works effectively? It's even harder to find a higher SPF Sunblock that meets these criteria. Well, Elta MD has not only delivered on these promises: They offer all this in a formula that looks so natural that it doesn't leave you looking like a ghost or mime. It also applies smoothly to work well under makeup. On top of this, it does not clog my acne-prone pores or dry out my face. It even comes in a tinted version and is made in the U.S.A. What more do you want?? This is my sun protection product for life."," February 2, 2017"
289,Amanda 📚,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen for skincare,  I have been using a zinc oxide mixed with coconut oil and a carrot seed oil (was trying the all natural route). I wasnt liking the application. I heard about EltaMD through Refinery29. I love how there's not a bunch of chemical ingredients (which is what we all should be avoiding). The majority is zinc oxide (which is the main ingredient I need).I am so far really loving this. I have been using it for 2 weeks. I haven't had any breakouts from it. If I still feel this way after the bottle is finished - I will def buy again.Only downfall = the price for the size. It isn't much product - but good products do cost more.," September 30, 2017"
290,Tess,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy grail of facial sunscreens,"  Look no further-this is the holy grail of facial sunscreens!  It doesn’t leave a cast, goes on smoothly, and is packed with safe and sensitive-skin friendly ingredients.  100% worth the price!  My kids also beg me to put this on their face because it doesn’t leave them looking like a ghost!"," June 17, 2020"
291,Zech,2.0 out of 5 stars,Protected but clumpy,  Not sure why it says clear because it still leaves a white film behind. Maybe I received an expired product or something but it leaves a very noticeable chalky film and doesn’t run in easily. Protection works well and eventually it rubs off but it isn’t what I expected. Canceled my auto shipment.," September 1, 2021"
292,may,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Look no further, this is the one!","  I've been struggling with rosacea for quite a while after my medical treatment this is what the doctor recommended for my super sensitive skin and it works perfect!Fast absorbing, it mousterizes my skin without an oily sensation leaving it smooth and calms my redness. Look no further, this is it!Ps. I'm a real customer I'm not getting payed in any way, shape or form for my review. I know the struggle sister."," October 8, 2021"
293,Phuong Le,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only thing my oily sensitive skin doesnt break out,"  I have like permanent acnes on forehead and chin bc I keep touching them when im stress, and stress also causes acnes. Other sunscreen brands break out my forehead even more but not this one. Highly recommend."," November 30, 2021"
294,J.Doe,1.0 out of 5 stars,Shine galore!!! Not for Oily skin,"  If you have oily skin this will make it worse! Your skin will look like you lathered butter on your face, it also leaves a waxy residue on skin after you wash it off, can’t imagine that being good for acne prone skin. This also contains a very toxic hormone disrupter!  Disappointed"," October 26, 2021"
295,Andrea Fairservice,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best zinc facial spf!,"  I LOVE this stuff. It’s one of only two SFPs I’ll put on my breakout prone face. (Hawaiian topics tinted spf is my other fave when I want to look like I’m wearing a little makeup!) it covers great, moisturizes, and most importantly: doesn’t break me out. I’ve had a lot of trouble finding a zinc based facial spf that works for me and now that I have I’m a customer for life."," February 23, 2021"
296,J. Noalani,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Sunscreen, Doesn’t Irritate the Skin","  EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen provides excellent sun protection.  It is very easy to spread on my face.  My dermatologist recommended this product, because other sunscreens were irritating my face and causing redness.  This sunscreen does not irritate my skin.  I am very pleased with this sunscreen."," July 20, 2021"
297,rick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dr recommended,  Sr recommended me to get this after finding some skin cancer on my face - it’s pricey but if I put it on with a tiny bit of moisturizer it goes all over well - lasts forever for such a small bottle - I cannot stand stuff on my face and this is weightless! The slight color is like makeup but very light - great product works well and dr recommended," February 8, 2021"
298,Cat,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very thick and sticky,  I'm assuming this is fake. WHICH is highly disappointing don't waste your money. The bottle I bought was not sealed. Heavy and caused acne.," September 7, 2021"
299,Nebahat,5.0 out of 5 stars,No white cast,"  As a person with brown skin, I can confirm that this sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast. As you are applying, in five seconds you'll see that the white tint goes away. I tried many sunscreens chemical/physical formulas over the past years, Drunk Elephant, Shiseido, Super Goop etc. This one stands out among them. I didn't get any breakouts. No goopy mess thanks to the pump bottle and reasonable price. I'll be purchasing again."," March 30, 2020"
300,Candle Chemist,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen hands down.,"  I have been using this product for 2 years now and wouldn't dream of changing.  It provides excellent protection and doesn't break me out.  I use it under my makeup everyday, but it doesn't feel heavy.  I'm a Floridian and in the sun a lot, so sunscreen is very important to me."," February 24, 2022"
301,Jeanette,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin,  I have rosacea and I had used Neutrogena face sunscreen. However my dermatologist recommended this and I have been very pleased with the product. Goes on smooth and it does work. I still don't want to leave it on my face any longer than I need to. But I would recommend it.," March 5, 2022"
302,MaryL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"  This sunscreen is on the pricey side but worth it. I have used it for many years on my face. However, it's too expensive for me to put it all over my body. Over the years, every dermatologist and skincare professional I have seen has recommended Elta MD for my skin. I've lived in very sunny parts of the country. Rain or shine, this sunscreen is a habit for me to wear every day."," December 21, 2021"
303,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stay away if you have dark skin and don't want to look ashen,"  I was looking for a sunscreen that (1) didn't leave a greasy shine and (2) wouldn't leave a white cast on my dark skin. This does only the first. I'm surprised it's included on lists as going on clear for  ""all skin types"" because it absolutely does not. Will be returning and trying Supergoop. next."," April 14, 2021"
304,Anne M. McMullen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"great product, lightweight and effective","  This was recommended to me by two dermatologists, one of whom competes on her horses.  It is an excellent product!  It's light weight, provides great coverage, does not cause any irritation to my face or any breakouts.  I have sent some to my daughter, who is an air force pilot, and she loves it!  This lasts all year for me and I used it every day.  Highly recommend!"," June 20, 2018"
305,Nikki,2.0 out of 5 stars,The good: -It did not break me out,"  The good:-It did not break me out.-Formula was light weight.The bad:-It made my liquid foundation separate throughout the day (especially in my chin area).-It leaves a strange white/purplish cast on my skin.-Super expensive.-The product pills up if you rub your face at all, resulting in little white balls all over.Not worth it for me. If I am going to buy high-end facial products, I'll stick to La Roche Posay."," April 18, 2018"
306,Danielle P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this and works great!,  My mom bought this for me on a recommendation from my dad’s dermatologist. He’s had several cancerous melanomas removed so she was on high alert since I have my dad’s fair skin. This spreads very smoothly and doesn’t burn my eyes like normal sunblock can when it gets near the eye are. I’ve never burnt with this lotion. Highly recommend!," August 19, 2021"
307,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,"  Almost every sunscreen I've used breaks me out, including the Korean brands that were really popular for a while. Well, I forgot my sunscreen on a trip and ordered this to replace it.... no breakouts, no burns. And it doesn't make my completely want to claw the sludge off my skin like most sunscreens do."," June 29, 2021"
308,Colette R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Turns into clumps,"  I had high hopes while putting it on, I thought it blended in really nice. But 20 minutes later I looked in the mirror and it had gathered into little white clumps. I looked like my face was coated in baby powder. No no. Don’t know how well it works as a sunscreen cause I was too embarrassed to leave it on."," June 12, 2021"
309,Chris S Haroun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best feeling daily sunscreen I've found,"  Feels great after it sets. I like it more than any other brand I've tried (cheap or expensive). Best yet, it doesn't make me break out... it seems to actually help keep my skin clear. It lasts a lot longer than I expected too!"," December 2, 2020"
310,Jackson15,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware !!!!!!!,"  First bottle I bought worked ok but the pump broke so I purchased another when it came I noticed the pump was completely different. About a week went by and I developed a terrible chemical burn on my neck and chin. I have stopped using this product and my burn is slowly getting better. I would return this product but the window has closed. Great product if you want painful burns, neck biopsy, expensive dermatology appointments and great deals of pain. It's one thing to be ripped off another to be physically hurt. If I ever see elta on the streets you know it's on."," June 17, 2017"
311,Piggles,2.0 out of 5 stars,Burns my face,"  I know everyone raves about this sunblock, but I get a stinging, burning sensation on my face for about 30 minutes after I put it on. No idea why. I usually don't have sensitive skin in this way. It's a little thin, too. Smells nice, though. Full disclosure, I do use retinol at night, but I've used two other high-end facial sunscreens since I've been using retinol and they don't burn."," September 4, 2020"
312,Minimalist who hates shopping,5.0 out of 5 stars,great product that surpasses more expensive suncreens!,"  This is a great product that I really believe has protected my skin from the sun. I'm 37 and I've tried many of the cheap drugstore brands (like Neutrogena) and more expensive department store brands (like clinique and Shiseido). This one combines the best features-- effectiveness in minimizing lines, provision of moisture, sun protection, light feel, no breakouts. I've used this for 2 years (after realizing that my Clinique product had been rubbing off and allowing sun through on certain parts of my face causing freckles and sunspots). I do believe that the user must take care to not rub her face or otherwise remove the sunscreen as she is applying blush, powder, or other makeup.  If you DO apply powder over this sunscreen, I would make sure that it has SPF as well since you might be rubbing this sunscreen of as you apply your power (if you're not careful). But if you are committed to using it correctly, I do believe that this product will provide great sun protection. I really like that it does not feel sticky or greasy like almost every other sunscreen. I sorta feel like I should send a sample to all my female friends who refuse to wear facial unscreen because they say it feels disgusting to them."," December 11, 2012"
313,regazzapaesa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Start young and use it daily forever!,  Love this product. I've used it in the tinted and clear formula.  I have REALLY sensitive skin and have used this for 3 years. No breakouts. No redness.  It seems little greesey when first applied but within a few minutes it's completely absorbed and completely invisible.  Unlike a LOT of the other facial sunscreens there's no white cast and makeup layers over it seamlessly.," October 3, 2020"
314,Catherine,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,  I have eczema and my face is very sensitive. I saved this product to use the week of my wedding. Used once and threw in the trash immediately. It caused an allergic reaction and I had cystic acne completely covering my entire face for a week.," May 25, 2019"
315,spud,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unsafe for humans and marine life!,"  Description is VERY misleading... It says mineral 'based', but in addition to zinc oxide, it also contains Octinoxate 7.5%, which is a chemical sunscreen. This info appears no where in this description. Octinoxate is unsafe for humans and our marine life!!  Octinoxate, an established endocrine disruptor, rated 5 by EWG. Sunscreens containing octinoxate are now banned in Hawaii. Octinoxate is also called Octyl methoxycinnamate or (OMC)."," August 16, 2021"
316,Julie V. Virgin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this sunscreen,  I've tried for years to find a good every day facial sunscreen. I have discoid lupus and sun protection is essential. I have used this every day for about a month now and continue to plan on using it. I've stopped using other moisturizers as this suffices. I haven't had any new lesions (no sunburns either). The only down fall is that at about 10-12 hours my skin gets really slimy.. like I can feel a layer of film over it. I just wash my face as it's mostly dark by then and it's fine. I haven't had any acne breakouts either. Definitely recommend," March 17, 2020"
317,K,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the sunscreens that my aesthetician recommended and also the sunscreen I always see while doing ...,"  Pricey for sunscreen, but I guess decent quality has those effects. This is the sunscreens that my aesthetician recommended and also the sunscreen I always see while doing research for ""best sunscreen to buy"" for my skin. Hesitant to purchse it at the salon despite their recommendation because of the $30 price. But then after much research, ended up buying it on amazon.Zinc Oxide is what we need to look for in the ingredients and while drugstore ones like neutrogena have it, it's too sticky and gunky on skin. It's fine for those who don't mind it, but the formula is not to my liking. This one is also favors acne prone skin like mine. It's lightweight, no white caste as other zinc oxide suncreens do, and it's not oily either.It keeps changing it's prices. I bought it initially for $33, and it's $30 at my salon. But then the second time I bought it, it was $26ish, which balanced the price out I guess. Maybe it's a buy one get the other one some 20% percent off or something I guess."," June 25, 2018"
318,Krlk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin,  I love this. I have used this for years. I have sensitive combo skin and this is the only sunscreen that is lightweight and doesn't break me out. It will pill if the layer you use before isn't completely dry. I find it sits well under makeup and the niacinamide helps to even out skin tone. I love this so much I recommend it to everyone who is trying facial sunscreen for the first time.," October 2, 2020"
319,Emily Dulaney,2.0 out of 5 stars,Peels horribly,  This product peels horribly. I could not get it to rub into my skin without it peeling and balling up. Even after allowing my products to dry and soak in it still peeled and crumbled. The finish is beautiful once you finally get it on. But I shouldn’t have to work this hard to apply SPF. Especially for one this expensive. For this price I expect my sunscreen to be compatible with the moisturizer I already own.," May 15, 2020"
320,JuJu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend,  It is light weight and  moisturizing. I put it on before I apply my makeup in the morning and it doesn't feel heavy.I showed my Dermatologist E ltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 because I have sensitive skin. He said he puts this on his children and it a great to use all the time.," March 19, 2020"
321,hrcon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eczema Friendly!,  I have developed eczema on my face and neck over the last year and have had to stop using all of my old go to products.  I needed an effective but sensitive facial sunscreen.  After lots of research online I bought this to give it a try.  It is fragrance-free and it hasn't irritated my sensitive skin at all. I wore it on a kayak trip last weekend and it provided perfect protection for my face - no sunburn!," May 28, 2020"
322,Jordan Buckley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen ever,"  Only SPF I will probably ever use. So good, doesn’t pill or cause weird texture or oiliness under makeup, doesn’t make you look greasy with or without makeup, feels so good when you put it on. Also great for men, it doesn’t pill up on facial hair or anything else. Me and my man loveee this."," November 11, 2021"
323,MrBudha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best One I’ve Used,"  Tried a few products from the big name brands but this is the best daily sunscreen I’ve tried. I was worried about the price and the size of the bottle but it goes a surprisingly long way. Not too greasy, goes on easy, just make sure to use a separate moisturizer."," March 18, 2022"
324,essa,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a good moisturizer,"  I bought this after recommendations by a dermatologist.  I prefer a one step product if possible - combination of moisturizer and spf protection.  I have normal, non-acne skin.  Unfortunately, this product was a bit drying and did not provide any moisture; it worked best with a moisturizer applied first - then applying this cream.  Also I noticed that if I did not wear a moisturizer, this cream would not be completely clear and my face would have a whitish hew.  A couple hours after application, I would also see whitish areas on the cheeks.  Probably because of the lack of moisturizer leading to some flaking?  I am going to try EltaMDs other product (EltaMD UV Daily SPF 40) as that one lists that it has hydrating ingredients to provide better moisturization.  I would not recommend this particular product in the line for normal or dry skin."," July 20, 2015"
325,Elizabeth Grace,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken & Missing Parts: Buyer Beware,"  The bottle came damaged and without a cap, and the box was smashed and showed signs of being opened. There are some marks around the container itself, and there’s no telling whether or not it has been used or tampered with as the cap with sticker seal is nowhere to be seen.As it was purchased specifically for my mom who has severe sensitivity, she can’t use it for fear that it may trigger her rosacea."," May 6, 2020"
326,Carolyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great non-greasy sunscreen for everyday,"  I have had this product for a week and so far it is great! I have very pale, very sensitive skin and have had no bad side effects from using this sunscreen. I was using the Neutrogena facial sunscreen before and it left my skin feeling greasy, irritated and caused pimples/breakouts. The Elta MD goes on clear, isn’t greasy at all and can go on under makeup. It has 9% zinc oxide, an ingredient that dermatologists recommend."," July 22, 2020"
327,Page Turner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will buy again,"  I am very happy with EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 for Sensitive or Acne-Prone Skin, Oil-free. It was one recommendation among many from the dermatologist after repeated visits for precancerous cells on my face. She had given higher end recommendations, this being one, along with less expensive ones, such as Neutrogena for sensitive skin and other Neutrogena products. Those either caused me to break out into a rash or were thick and would leave me with white patches if I didn't rub in enough. This Elta MD is very light and no rash. I have not tested sun protection yet because so far I'm wearing a hat, even when driving. I would definitely recommend this product for the light feel."," May 26, 2020"
328,Kasey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price.,"  I never thought I’d spend this much on face sunscreen but I turned 30 and well, here we are. The good news is I am IN LOVE with this and will be a loyal customer from now on. It’s so lightweight and basically scentless, which I love. I’ve even put it on my toddler who has very sensitive skin and he tolerated it great."," May 3, 2021"
329,zigzagg,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is great!,"  I have been using it for years.  It is expensive and it runs out without a lot of warning but it is bullet proof.  I have light northern European skin, I can put this stuff on and wear it most of the day.  No burning even in the desert.  No zits, either.The no zits, the absolute best part.  It makes your face a little white when you first put it on but it doesn't need refreshing constantly."," May 24, 2020"
330,Jackie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sunscreen, but don't buy here (came opened)","  This item came already opened. I could tell as soon as I looked at the bottle, as it had a little bit of the product around the opening (see phot). When I pumped it, the product immediately came out - with a new product, it would require several pumps before anything came out. From now on I'm only getting from Costco or my dermatologist. It's such a bummer to return this, as I know the product will just go in the bin, but I can't believe they thought they could sell me opened goods."," August 31, 2019"
331,"Mom, wife, nurse",5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,  I hate wearing sunscreen on my face because I hate the way it feels. This is so light weight that I cannot tell I even have it on. Did a great job protecting my face and neck from the hot sun. I did not get sun burned and all. I love it. This is my new go to sunscreen for my face," March 12, 2022"
332,Melissa H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and great for acne prone skin,"  I purchased this sunscreen on a recommendation of  a blogger I follow, hisugarplum.  She used it on her vacation as recommened by her sons dermatologist.  My husband has acne prone skin and fishes, so he likes somehting that doesn't run in his eyes, protects and doesn't clog pores.  This suncreen is lightweight and perfect for the entire famiy to use.  It doesn't have that sunscreen smell either, which I appreciate. One of the best sunscreens I have purchased."," August 12, 2020"
333,Jennifer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend,"  This is a fantastic sunscreen. I have acne prone, sensitive skin with eczema. Have been using this for months now, ordering my second bottle. I never used to wear sunscreen because I didn’t like the feel on my face. This goes on totally smooth and doesn’t leave greasy. Provides enough moisture to typically use alone (a bit more is needed for me in winter, I have very dry skin).  Is a bit shiny after application but makeup handles that. Without makeup the shine dies down with a bit of time."," July 18, 2019"
334,Attis Bouillon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pump Broken,  The pump was broken and I bought so many that I didn't look at this one until after the return date was passed. It's basically trash now and I'm bummed.," July 19, 2021"
335,Shirah Jacobs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, don't use with makeup","  I typically hate the smell of sunscreen, but this one has very little smell which is amazing! It has a lightweight texture, making it much more comfortable to wear. It didn't break me out, and the niacinamide helped reduce post-inflamatory hyperpigmentation from the acne I already had. While it did have some whitecast, it's much less than other sunscreen products I've tried. I have mildly textured skin, and it applied evenly enough for the slight whitecast to be uniform instead of patchy, making the whitecast less noticeable. All that said, I don't recommend wearing it with makeup, as it peels when rubbed. Reapplying can also cause some peeling/patchiness in the product, so I'd recommend wiping some of the earlier layers off with a damp cloth before reapplying."," March 24, 2020"
336,Some Dude,5.0 out of 5 stars,she ran out of her $50 sunscreen that she said was the only thing that helped (didn't really) (also we understand how spf works,"  My mother has struggled for years with acne, redness, and other face related irritations.  She's gone to several dermatologists, has had skin biopsys, been diagnosed with so many things from autoimmune disorders, to protein disorders, and other skin conditions.  Nothing has helped, at some point in the day, sometimes without going outside, her face would turn bright red, think of very severe rosacea.  One day, she ran out of her $50 sunscreen that she said was the only thing that helped (didn't really) (also we understand how spf works and after a certain amount its pretty pointless, so I never understood why she was buying those super expensive high spf sunscreens), so I told her I'd order her one on amazon.  After digging for awhile, I stumbled on this listing.  The price still seemed high for a sunscreen as compared to your generic store brand, but this one seemed to soothe the skin and help with rosacea.  I pulled the trigger, now we are on our second bottle.  I don't know why, but this is like miracle cream, her skin problems are about 90% gone, her face has cleared up, not a sight of redness anywhere.  We are now done spending so much on other creams, this serves as a jack of all trades.  Probably will be ordering this stuff for life, really a night and day difference for my mother and worth every penny."," February 19, 2016"
337,Zeda,2.0 out of 5 stars,Drying,  It's not a completly physical sunscreen. I got it because my skin gets red from most non-ZnO sunscreen but I got itchy from this. Left my skin a bit dry," September 9, 2021"
338,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Caused dry flaky skin,"  I was really disappointed in this product. I bought it based on my dermatologist's recommendation to prevent/improve melasma and it went on nicely. I could feel a thin layer but didn't bother me much. Then I wore a mask every day at work and within two days I had dry flaking skin wherever my mask touched. I tried to just use it on my forehead and then my eyebrows started getting dry and flaky and it took days to get it to go away. I can only wear it when I go out in the sun and then have to make sure I scrub it off right after, which defeats the purpose of using it as a daily moisturizer. Maybe I didn't wash it off well enough initially but I don't really want to worry about this problem as it's really unsightly."," March 30, 2021"
339,M W,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caused Severe Reaction,"  I do not have sensitive skin and this product has me in misery after one application.  It caused a rash and it feels like my entire face and neck has a chemical burn...dry, red, burning, slight itch and a general feeling of tenderness.  I was not in the sun but was attempting to find a light sunscreen for daily use.  I used it Thursday and it is now Saturday evening and my face actually feels like it is getting worse.  I have never in my life experienced this after using a skincare or sunscreen product.  Unbelievably disappointed."," July 5, 2020"
340,Rob H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,"  In the past I have only used common drugstore sunscreens. They were either too greasy, chalky white or ran into my eyes. Coming from off-the-shelf products I was a bit hesitant due to the price, but often you get what you pay for. I have a very fair complexion and have battled some rosacea. This sunscreen goes on a bit white but disappears quickly. I am now using it every day and for all occasions which is how a sunscreen should be used."," June 12, 2021"
341,Nicole M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Actually calms my skin,"  This sunscreen is really nice. It disappears into skin and my skin actually looks a little less red/more calm after I put it on. (I'm probably Fitzpatrick's 2 or 3). The first couple months, it reacted with other products I was using by pilling up, but I've either removed those products or my skin has balanced out. I think Niacinamide sometimes causes the problem or a moisturizer I was using with a high amount of silicone. Be sure to use enough; it's thin and goes on easily so it's easy to miss spots. :) I'm going to try the tinted version next!"," April 12, 2020"
342,BuckeyeGalForever,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased with It,"  So far I am loving this sunscreen. I have tried at least a dozen or more others and have not liked a single one of them for one reason or another. I can't say for certain that it's my HG but it's certainly close. It dispenses by an easily controllable pump. Though it is white when dispensed and when first applied, as you gently rub it in it becomes clear and sinks into your skin. It leaves no white cast or residue. After allowing it to settle in a bit, I sometimes add a bit of primer mixed with a drop of Cover FX unless I need to go someplace special (which never happens). That gives me the sun protection necessary for my lupus and a bit of a finished look for being at home and not scaring the dog. Granted I do take special precautions to limit my sun exposure but this sunscreen does seem to do a good job without all the draw backs usually associated with similar products. I'm pleased with it."," May 8, 2015"
343,Lacey C,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,  I bought this on a good friends recommendation. It did protect my skin from the sun but the next day all around my nose and mouth and chin was peeling like it sucked the moisture out of my skin. I tried multiple times and I think my skin just doesn’t like something in this sunscreen.," July 4, 2021"
344,shuh,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight but sometimes pills up,"  First off, I've never gotten a sunburn using this stuff, so it does its job.It goes on clear as advertised and is lightweight but at the same time packs a pretty good SPF punch. Typically when I've used facial moisturizer/sunscreen combos above SPF 15 I've found the texture to be too thick/tacky for my liking. This is great in that it soaks right in and therefore doesn't deter me from using a higher SPF in my daily routine, which is important as my job requires me to be outside a lot.I've found though that when using this sunscreen in conjunction with certain other moisturizers or serums it will not sink in but rather pill up in little white balls. Not a huge issue for me - I just wash my face and start over using a different product with the sunscreen. I currently use it mixed with a moisturizer - one squirt of SPF, one squirt of moisturizer, give it a quick rub between my hands to mix and then pat it on my face. Makes my morning routine easy peasy!"," October 31, 2013"
345,Teacher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect sunscreen for the face,"  This sunscreen worked very well this past week at the lake. I spent time on the boat and I got no sunburn on my face unlike many other products I have tried. I’m very happy with it. It goes on clear, has a nice consistency, and disappeared into my skin. I didn’t feel I needed to use a lot because it spread so easily. Also, it had only the lightest scent that I only noticed when I applied it. I highly recommend this product."," July 16, 2021"

THE PRODUCT CAME DAMAGED AND SUN SCREEN WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AMAZON REFUSED TO SEND REPLACEMENT. THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT, IVE USED IT BEFORE BUT AMAZON SURPRISED ME IN A VERY NEGATIVE WAY TODAY WHEN REJECTED SENDING THE REPLACEMENT OF A SENT DAMAGED PRODUCT. WAY TO LOSE A COSTUMER."," December 30, 2020"
347,llei,1.0 out of 5 stars,Octinoxate present- endocrine disruptor,"  I cannot attest to the product's coverage or qualities other than the fact it has OCTINOXATE in it. If you are looking for a chemical free sunscreen, keep on looking. I unfortunately didn't see it listed. In fact, I had to comb through the product listing to find the full ingredients list. Octinoxate is known to disrupt your endrocrine system, mimicking hormones over time."," February 10, 2021"
348,Amber,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST Sunscreen Moisturizer,"  As someone who has an acne-prone, oily in parts and dry in others, face, this is the best moisturizer I have found. I originally got it from my mother in law who purchased hers from her dermatologists office. What I love is that it does not feel greasy, or leave my face looking like an oil slick AND has SPF 46- none of this SPF 15 stuff that doesn't protect your face from the sun. It is a bit pricey but is totally worth it. I break out less too since using it because it really doesn't clog your pores."," December 27, 2018"
349,Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is magic in a bottle,"  My friend told me to get this stuff and I’m glad I listened! Not only does it protect my fair skin from the sun all day (even while sweating) but I swear it’s good for my skin! Leaves it moisturized, soft and supple. I’m a big fan and a lifetime customer for sure!"," July 19, 2021"
350,Fabs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen for acne.,"  I never review products but I wanted to review this one. EltaMD UV clear facial sunscreen is the best facial sunscreen that I’ve ever used. I am a dark skin woman,  and the cream becomes transparent  when rubbed in. The sun protection is very good however you must remember to reply frequently when swimming. The best benefit of the screen is that it cured my son’s acne! My teenage son has mostly cystic acne and blackheads.  I had him use this sunscreen on his face while on vacation last month and within a week I saw a drastic improvement in his skin. He’s been now using it about three weeks and his acne is almost gone. I wasn’t expecting such a benefit when I got EltaMD but I’m so glad I bought it. Sunscreen usually causes both him and I break out like crazy. Not EltaMD! He has been on benzyl peroxide and salicylic acid for at least a year and the results of eltaMD  far surpass anything achieved peroxide and salicylic acid. I hope they will continue to product this provide indefinitely."," September 11, 2019"

354,BamaJo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"  I have been using this product for about 2 years now and I was happy to find it a few dollars cheaper on Amazon.  I am 45 years old and still suffer occasional acne and I also have Melasma which is when patches of dark skin appear on areas of the face exposed to the sun - and no you do not have to be pregnant for this is occur.  I have an olive complexion but the dark patches are so ugly.  I go get laser treatment to remove them and this sunscreen really helps to prevent dark patches from reoccurring without clogging my pores.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who still breaks out but wants to protect their face from the sun.  I use it on my clean skin and follow with my regular skincare regiment and then my makeup.  It is a pain to have to put so many layers on each day, but I know that I do not look as old as others my age and I love activities outdoors making sunscreen a must. I hope it continues to work for me as it is the best thing I have found and believe me I have tried a lot of products."," June 24, 2013"
355,Grace E.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Greasy, may not be makeup friendly","  Being an ultra pale sort I'm always on the lookout for a fantastic daily sunscreen and after seeing all the rave reviews I was hoping that this might be it. For the record - I have dry skin (upgraded to incredibly dry during the winter) - so I'm not exactly the target demographic for this sunscreen. Having dry skin my main concern with this product was that it would leave my skin unbearably dry and tight feeling throughout the day - but boy was I ever wrong. On my skin this sunscreen never really dried down or absorbed into my skin - it just remained greasy and slick, sitting ontop of my skin. With or without a makeup primer my foundation had rubbed off of my face before the middle of the day and by the end of the day I would have apparent oily patches on my forehead and nose (I have dry skin and it's the middle of this polar vortex winter!).This product clearly works very well for many people, but if it just isn't working right for you there are many other fantastic products on the market. Shiseido's Urban Environment line happens to work very well for my skin (although it's too perfume-y for my taste) and behaves nicely with my makeup."," January 30, 2014"
356,Catherine0404,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"  Honestly, I really don't understand the hype about this sunscreen. I bought it because it's supposed to be ""good for my skin"", but it just makes me red and shiny, and I hate how it feels on my skin. I have acne and melasma and this really does nothing for me. It's really too bad, it does seem to have decent sun protection though."," December 13, 2020"

358,Shalisa Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Acne Scars!,"  The best face sunscreen I have tried. Does not break me out and in fact helps with any past breakout scars I do have. Never had any problems with irritation.

360,Mara,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective dispenser makes it unusable!,"  Really liked this sunscreen at first, but after using it only 5 times the pump dispenser stopped working!  I am irritated since I have almost a full tube that I can't use unless I break the top off, which will make it unhygienic & difficult to dispense. Also I was on vacation in a foreign country when it broke & had a difficult time getting replacement sunscreen.  A relatively expensive product should have better quality control!"," October 28, 2019"

I have never in my life had a sunscreen that didn't break me out without leaving a horrible, strong white cast on my face. I am pale, but even I can't pull that off. And finding a sunscreen that matches that description that also plays nice with makeup over it? Ha, good luck. But this product does all of that, and I can't believe it. Zero extra shine, my foundation doesn't separate or look weird, and no white cast. It also absorbs quickly; I just apply it, do my eyebrows, and then I'm ready for foundation. This is a sunscreen I will actually use every day because it is a zero compromise product, and that's a huge deal."," March 29, 2016"

I was highly highly impressed with this one - blends in well, not oily at all - at the same times doesn't dry the skin - keeps it well moisturized, no shiny face after application, absorbs well and gives a natural finish after 5-10mins.  I got the tinted and clear one - if you use the tinted one - you dont need foundation. I saw this in the ""Doctorly"" list of recommendations and decided to get it. BEST decision ever made!!

I don't want to say I have rosacea (I do!) or acne (I have that, too!), but my dermo thought this sun screen/ face moisturizer would work for me and it has! I've been using it for over two years and whenever I run out and revert to my store brand, I break out something bad! This stuff goes on smooth, absorbs, and gives me less shine throughout the day. The bottle last a good while--I'm careful to push the pump once or twice to make it last, but it is without a doubt worth it!Oh, and my dermo charges twice what Amazon does.Dropping from 5 to 3 stars:***update 11/16 - last order I received the product was yellowish instead of white.

I wish it was slightly more affordable as I go through a lot (am, sunscreen, and pm moisturizer) but my skin has never looked better or healthier.

368,M. Zepe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great facial sunscreen even under makeup,"  My dermatologist in Atlanta recommended this sunscreen because I had spent so much time in FL my skin started to have patchy discoloration (of course not a nice tan like everyone else gets from the sun!)  even though I was applying a drugstore facial sunscreen so I bought it from her office but I've been ordering this on Amazon ever since.I love this product because (1) it is very sheer not greasy and goes under makeup flawlessly (2) it is super skin friendly and doesn't burn or irritate my skin (3) it lasts and lasts.I have tried other facial sunscreen from the drug store and even the ones that claim to be calming irritate my skin. It completely vanishes into the skin and does not turn your skin white. I apply this under my bare minerals makeup daily.My boyfriend is a sweaty sweaty man and he puts thIs sunscreen all over his face and his shaved head and even when he sweats this product does not sting or burn. This is the only sunscreen my boyfriend will use.This product lasts too. I will put this on my face in the morning, spend all day at the beach and my face is not burned at the end of the day."," September 11, 2015"

Plays well with my mild rosacea and cruelty free is also a plus.The only thing I don't like about it is that it dries VERY shiny. Not a problem if I'm wearing it under makeup, but otherwise I have to dust it with setting powder so I don't look like an oil slick.

Rubs in beautifully, though!"," March 31, 2021"
375,Ms. W,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sunscreen for the face,"  I have researched facial sunscreens high and low to find one that is not greasy feeling, not heavily fragranced, and made with safe ingredients. This scores a 2 on the Environmental Working Group's safety rating (on a scale of 0 to 10, 10 being the worst). I really like this sunscreen and it does all of the things the previous reviewers say. Does not clog pores, is good for oilier skin, does not feel greasy, etc. It feels good on the face, as if you are not wearing sunscreen at all. The ONLY issue for me is that I have very sensitive and fair skin and on a couple of occasions when I have gotten really sweaty (Texas summer, 100*+), my skin has gotten a little irritated. I honestly think that it's because I don't do as well with high SPF sunscreens, so I should have gotten the SPF 35 rather than the 46. My mistake, but it's not an issue every day by any means. I will get the lower SPF next time, but I would definitely buy this brand again."," August 23, 2011"
376,Joseph Humphrey,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s ok.,"  I was recommended this product for chronic sun damage from my youth to try to help reduce any further damage. It feels lighter than traditional sun screen, but I still cannot get it to disappear on my face; it leaves my face pink for about an hour or so after application. The directions state to use every couple of hours a day as the sun protection wears off, so instead a red face all day, it’s a muted whitish-pink.I should try one of the tinted ones to see it that’s any better."," February 12, 2020"
377,Natalie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Burns when I sweat!,  After hearing so many good things about this sunscreen for break out prone skin I was excited to try it. Unfortunately for me my skin didn't like it. It has a nice texture and absorbs well but I wore this while on a vacation that involved lots of walking and sweating. Once I started sweating this made my face burn to the point that it was painful! I know it was this sunscreen because it was the only new addition to my skincare and the next day I didn't wear it and I also didn't have the burning sensation when I would sweat. I gave three stars since it does feel nice and absorb well.," August 20, 2017"
378,James D. Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Protection,"  Bought this as it is the brand my dermatologist sells.  I had run out of the first one, and when I bought the second one from her office, they sold me the ""tinted"" one.  When you start sweating, that tint will rub off on whatever you wipe your sweat with.  So, went back to this clear one.  I work on Habitat homes, and will be out in the sun from 8am to 3pm.  This offers great protection all day."," May 25, 2020"
379,Eileen O. Wright,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sun protection but drying.,"  I’d been wanting to try this sunscreen for awhile now mainly for its suitability for rosacea sufferers.

I’ve been trying with a moisturizer as a first layer and waiting to apply, but it is still a little drying."," November 6, 2020"
380,books-aholic60,1.0 out of 5 stars,?For sensitive skin?,"  I have been using this product for years with no problems.  I use the tinted version, which evens my skin tone but makes my skin look very oily.  This oiliness is new. It has happened with the last two bottles purchased here.  Gives a moderate sunscreen...I have to apply it frequently, especially outdoors.  The new bottles made my eyes burn terribly.  I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw my eye doctor and he said I was having an allergic reaction to something getting into my eyes,  not a seasonal allergy problem.  I live in the south and love the outdoors, so I sweat a lot. My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen, but I think I'm going to ask about an alternative.  Something has changed in the formulation, and it is not an improvement.  You can see my red eyes and increased bags from the reaction."," July 11, 2014"
381,Mary Clark Rardin,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Must Have Sunscreen,"  I wish I didn't love this stuff as the price tag is high for the amount of sunscreen you actually get. Why am I such a hopeless addict to the Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46? Let me explain.I'm 27 and have oily, acne-prone skin. It's calmed down recently but I started using this sunscreen two years ago when I had a lot more break outs. I have had HORRIBLE breakouts when using sunscreen, everything from drug store to high end. I'm talking cystic acne that leaves scars behind. You can imagine that I was reticent to try a new kind  but my mom thought the ingredients looked good and recommended it to me after getting a sample. Since I'm from the South and spend time in Central America, I know that a sunscreen is a daily necessity.First, let's talk about the texture. This sunscreen goes on fairly sheer. However, realize that it is not formulated like most chemical sunscreens so you might have to work to rub it in a bit. It will look shiny on your skin and then settles down a bit. It actually feels nice on your skin and doesn't smell as strong as some sunscreens.I find that my makeup applies nicely as long as I wait about 2 minutes for it to settle in. You might look a bit ghostly in pictures so keep that in mind. Now, here's why I'm so in love: It makes your skin look better! Seriously! I can tell a difference in my skin when I run out of this stuff within a few days. It gets drier and bumpier and the fine lines around my eyes and forehead show up more easily.Oh, and I've never gotten burned while using this stuff. Even in super sunny Costa Rican weather.So, while I would love Eltamd to make a bigger bottle of this stuff and at least offer a small discount, I'm hooked. If you've had trouble with sunscreens, give this stuff a try."," July 3, 2015"

I've been on the hunt forever and have tried so many mineral sunscreens that I always end up hating. I have olive skin and am always left with a pasty white face. This is super lightweight and goes on nicely, leaving me with minimal to no white cast. I've had trouble with pilling and my skin ends up a little flaky/crusty at the end of the day (I have dry skin). The pilling might be due to other products I use under (hyaluronic acid to combat dryness). Overall, great mineral sunscreen with minimal cast and fragrance."," November 12, 2020"

394,babyruf,1.0 out of 5 stars,Burns my fave,"  I bought this ridiculously expensive sunscreen on the expectation it would be gentle. No. It burns my face and leaves red splotches. It also dries out my face so badly, it looks like my face is covered in powder"," November 7, 2021"
395,Evelyn Noaghi Cooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't break me out,"  It is hard to find a good sunscreen. This one is great. I really like it. I have oily, acne prone and sensitive skin. I use a lot of active ingredients which make my skin dry, so this one doesn't hydrate me so much so next time I'll try the other one which more hydrating. It feels nice on the skin and doesn't leave a white cast. The only problem is that a little pricy, but it is a very good product."," June 5, 2020"
396,Amanda,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dangerous product DO NOT USE,  Absolutely horrible causes facial burns would not use will contact amazon for a full retrun dangerous product do not useReally bad white casts but the worst part is it pills too much.Doesn't cause acne but the pilling is not worth it for the price.," March 5, 2021"
397,Paola,1.0 out of 5 stars,EMPTY BOTTLE.,"  I am beyond upset. This is an expensive sunscreen, which I love. I tried to use my bottle many times and nothing came out. Pump is acting like something it’s coming but nothing. I shook the bottle and a tiny bit came out. That was for one day. I can not use it every since. I am frustrated because I have no sunscreen whatsoever."," April 10, 2021"
398,S. Scruff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best UV block I've used, so far.","  This is the least noticeable sunscreen I've used. It's hard to find one that isn't shiny, or chalky. It melts in like a good lotion, and it actually has some well-known ingredients found in the nicer moisturizers. Whether or not any of those ingredients do anything, I have no idea, but some appear more respected than others, niacinamide being one, which allegedly mitigates pigment production.I feel like I've noticed improvement in my skin, but this isn't the only product I've been using so it's hard to say. It's the face product I've been using most consistently though, every day for over a month, so.. Really, it's worth it to me for being free of most controversial chemicals and having some popular ones in it. If that's psychological, so be it."," September 7, 2015"

400,ESenger,5.0 out of 5 stars,Goes on smooth,"  It goes on so smooth, not like your typical thick sunscreen. I recently bought an affordable, store bought sunscreen that specified it was for the face but it was horrible! I'm so glad I bought this one now.I don't wear foundation so I can't say how it would work under makeup but it's not thick or tacky so I imagine it would be fine."," May 28, 2020"
401,i.pnda,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too many cons :(,"  Pros: Has UVA & UVB coverage with high SPF.Cons: I am pretty sensitive to the sent of traditional sunscreen so I do not like the scent of this product.  Thankfully the smell goes away as it dries but still, putting it on is no fun.  Also, this product has caused some minor breakouts/bumps for me.  The biggest problem that I have with this product is that it pills when I rub in the product so I end up with little flakes of product everywhere. I use the product by patting it into my face but if I put makeup over it, I will still have the same pilling problem.  In the end this prevents me from wanting to use the product."," August 30, 2018"
402,Janet,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tinted Face sunscreen,  I have purchased this product three times and each time i have made sure it says it is CLEAR facial sunscreen. When it arrives it is tinted a light tan color!!  We want to use it for the entire family on their faces but many do not want to use a tan tinted face sunscreen. It is deceptive when it says clear face sunscreen and it comes with a color. This is my one big issue.I like the product. Just not the beige tinting.," October 10, 2019"
403,B.Romantica,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, a moisturizer with sunscreen protection that doesn't reek of sunblock","  I'm in the middle of a course of IPL and microdermabrasion treatments, which makes my skin sensitive and exposed, so my doctor told me that I must wear a high sunscreen on my face if I am ever going to be outside.  Besides that, we should all be wearing some sort of sunblock on our face no matter what.  Two of the things I hate about sunscreen though is that it can clog my pores and smells terrible.  Since I was also running out of moisturizer, I decided I would look into investing into a good two-in-one, and I was fortunate to find one here on Amazon.com on my first try.  Eltamd SPF 46 creamy formula feels great on my face, soothing my dry skin, and doesn't have an unpleasant scent.  One pump is enough to cover my entire face.  It absorbs quickly into my skin, which is great first thing in the morning when I need to put on makeup and get to work."," July 14, 2013"
404,Sarah Critchfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"  This a great sunscreen for anyone who particularly cares about taking care of their skin. With the hot temperatures and particularly sunny days I have been having recently in my area, I must say it works great. I work with kids too, and during this pandemic all they want to do is play outside. So far, no sunburns so the protection is definitely there, and I definitely do not think it is clogging my pores or anything like that. Highly recommend!"," September 23, 2020"
405,Cherstarr,1.0 out of 5 stars,I’ll try the product again but from a retail store. My face was protected from the sun,  It was hard to spread and left a white film on my face. I think it’s an old tube. I’m returning for a refund," July 1, 2021"
406,yaya007,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light & Great for Acne-prone Skin,"  I am 27 and have dealed with moderate face & back acne since I was 13. My acne cleared up from age 24-26 and now I have adult hormonal acne (I just can't seem to catch a break!). My dermatologist advised me to use a sunscreen even though I am a tan Asian that never burns, and I did some Googling and found this sunscreen. I decided what do I have to lose and with Amazon Prime I would get it in two days to try. I'm glad I did. My skin has improved and unlike other sunscreen my face isn't as oily as it would normally be. It def is a peace of mind knowing that I'm protecting my skin and it's helping my acne. Love it, recommend it, will repurchase again.But I do want to know, why the hell is the 3.4oz size more than triple the price of the 1.7oz?!"," October 13, 2013"
407,Aly,4.0 out of 5 stars,Oily and Smells Like Sunscreen!,"  This product is a great sunscreen!! Has not made me break out, however I have felt oily on the days I use it and constantly get whiffs of sunscreen throughout the day. I do use it over my face lotion (as dermatologist recommended), but it makes me feel like my face is cakey and gross."," March 17, 2021"
408,J.B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well under makeup and I don't break out,"  I have an assortment of sunscreens that I use when I'm outside running or being active. Most of my makeup has sunscreen in it so I really didn't have a dedicated facial sunscreen to use all the time, which is bad I know. I saw this listed as one of my limited time deals and after reading the reviews, I decided to get it.One complaint I have about most sunscreens is that they are too heavy and/or greasy. They are awkward under makeup and they make me break out or look oily. This sunscreen is matte! It also feels so light and works perfectly as a primer under foundation. On its own, it makes my skin look matte and less porous.I will still use my waterproof running/triathlon sunscreens when I'm out being sweaty but for the rest of the time, this is absolutely perfect. I am SO glad I saw it as a featured discount item!"," July 17, 2013"
409,Alexandra Finnegan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,  Lovely formula that doesn’t leave a terrible white cast (still does but faint). Haven’t burned yet! Holds up well when I walk/run outside. I have not experienced any break outs yet either! Happy I found this product!," May 25, 2021"
410,Debora B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great quality sunscreen, no breakouts after use","  I decided to try this sunscreen after seeing many recommendations on several fashion bloggers that I follow. They all swear by its amazing quality and how it does not cause skin breakouts. And I totally agree. This is one great quality product that works very good on my sensitive skin, offers great sun protection and it is moisturizing."," June 9, 2020"
411,Bri J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job!,"  I have super-oily, acne-prone, sensitive facial skin with natural redness. I've been using this exact sunscreen for years now and I've had no problems with it. Initially it makes your skin look shiny/oily, but eventually that goes away."," June 27, 2021"
412,Yessenia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen to TRY!,  I enjoy applying this sunscreen and have noticed that it doesn't pill unless I rub it in completely. I like how it gives a glow as well with no whitecast. This sunscreen goes perfectly with my other products which has not always been the case for me. This is my favorite sunscreen and am already going through my second bottle. I would highly recommend to anyone who has any oiliness or just trying to find something that will not cause a breakout. This sunscreen does have a smell but it is not overwhelming and the finish is worth it!," November 30, 2021"
413,Ladycroft214 ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Current go-to,  My daily pick. Seems to work great. Wears under makeup pretty well. Not sure how good it is in terms of being in direct sunlight for prolonged periods as I try to avoid the sun at all costs. No white cast.," October 30, 2021"
414,Amby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous product,  I bought this after my usual stuff by Drmtlgy became hard to come by. It's great and a little goes a long way. My skin is darker and I didn't have any whitish cast when using. It feels smooth going on and offers a bit of moisturizing.," June 21, 2021"
415,Kate_08_,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I would have bought it sooner,"  Worth the money and so nice on my skin in the morning. I was able to submit for reimbursement from my FSA, too. Love this product especially for my sensitive, redness prone, dry, and occasional acne skin."," January 21, 2022"
416,Berner Farm girl,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only 1 and a half applications for face possible,"  Bought for a trip Sept 27 - Oct 7 in a a sunny location. The one bought in May worked great, this one able apply for one application and then a dribble for a partial application the next day - a REAL rip off.  I contacted the company on return but they did not respond.They need to work on getting rid of this container and use a tube - suggest you buy Avene SPF 50 insteadcomments by a board certified dermatologist"," October 11, 2018"
417,Chante,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dries out my face throughout the day,"  I liked this sunscreen at first because it blended in well during the first application of the day but it dries out my skin midday (mostly in the U zone). I originally thought it was because of the mask I wear but even on a maskless day, it dries out my skin. On reapplication it also leaves a white cast"," August 10, 2021"
418,Nes,1.0 out of 5 stars,gave me cystic acne,"  I bought this since it was recommended by Curology for acne-prone skin. My first impression was that I loved how thin the consistency was compared to other facial sunscreens. However, the first time I used it I got about 6-7 cystic acne bumps pop up literally over night. Thinking that maybe I was just purging from Curology I tried it again and once again I got a few big red bumps before the day even ended! Sad and still trying to find a decent sunscreen that will not break me out.."," December 12, 2018"
419,Judith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Protects me from sun damage…….,"  …...and makes my skin feel great.  My dermatologist recommended it,  She said this was great for protection from the harmful rays of the sun and as a moisturizer for my foundation,  I wear it everyday and I am frequently complimented on my complexion,  That makes this 78 year old feel special.  I credit Elta MD!"," August 28, 2020"
420,EastCoastMama,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wont buy again,  I loved that i didnt break out but i used it before the pool and read that i need waterproof sunscreen plus this to protect from sun! Whats the point. It was so sheer that i felt no protection from it at all.," September 20, 2021"
421,corinne r,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend.,  I usually can’t tolerate the feel of a mineral sunscreen but this one goes on light and doesn’t leave a white film. Perfect for after skin care and under make up. Will definitely reorder.," September 18, 2020"
422,M. Shults,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Light as a feather, and no burning eyes, and noi zits.","  This stuff is great, giving good sun protection in a light-as-a-feather lotion, that goes on and sinks in effortlessly. I've been using it for a couple weeks and it doesn't cause pimples, and doesn't run into and burn my eyes if I sweat. This stuff was a great find and is perfect if you're looking for something you can use every day to avoid sun damage! I'm very happy with it, and so is my dermatologist!"," August 19, 2019"
423,Mackenzie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ruined my face for two days,"  A $40 sunscreen that made my face look red, irritated, dry, and OLDER for two days even after washing it off. I have NEVER had this happen with any skin care product, or any product for that matter. I am quite annoyed that I also could not get a refund because the return window had closed. This is very unprofessional in my opinion, and says a lot about a company who won't reimburse a customer after their product caused such a bad reaction. Buyer beware."," September 2, 2021"
424,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sunscreen, but leaves white cast","  I've been using this sunscreen for a few weeks now. I have very acne prone skin and this hasn't caused me to break out, so I love it! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the white cast it leaves. I have medium olive skine and this makes my skin appear slightly grey and pale, but it's still not as bad as most sunscreens do. If you have more fair skin, it probably won't be an issue, but deeper skin tones I probably wouldn't recomend."," August 31, 2019"
425,MKL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Necessity,  Doesn’t make me break out. Makeup goes smoothly on top of it. It feels very moisturizing too which is nice for this old lady. My only wish was that it was a little cheaper or the bottle was bigger. I go through so much.," December 18, 2020"
426,Blake,5.0 out of 5 stars,favorite sunscreen of all time,"  The last sunscreen I used make my face super oily in the t-zone area. So I went on a quest to find a reliable sunscreen. So this might be my only sunscreen for my face I’ll ever need. It doesn’t make my face oily or break out or leave a white cast.  Also, the ingredients are pretty much malassezia folliculitis safe"," October 2, 2020"
427,Phytofemme,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST for skin prone to hyperpigmentation or post surgical procedure,"  My skin is incredibly prone to hyperpigmentation.  My skin is a Fitzpatrick scale III with freckles, and I have had Fraxel DUAL laser resurfacing.  In spite of me applying sunscreen every two hours, most don't provide complete coverage, until I discovered this sunscreen.  Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 shines above all others.  I never have any break-through pigmenting. It doesn't clog my pores, even when I layer it multiple times throughout the day OVER my makeup.  After reapplication (on top of my makeup), it doesn't take long for my skin to absorb it so it doesn't feel thick.  I do have dry skin, so keep this in mind if your skin is typically more oily.  I love this sunscreen so much I always keep a backup bottle.  I also use Peter Thomas Roth Instant Mineral Sunscreen (http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Thomas-Roth-Anti-Aging-Instant/dp/B005HJLA12/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1415208686&sr=8-6&keywords=powder+sunscreen) which is equally as effective for preventing hyperpigmentation."," November 5, 2014"
428,Tim,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen ever!,"  I initially bought this because it got good reviews on one of those websites that talks about secret bad ingredients in sunscreen.  I figured it was better to be safe than sorry.  And while it's definitely more expensive than cheaper stuff, I love it.  It goes on extremely easily, rubs in almost immediately, and doesn't leave my face white at all.  I've tried a few of the ""better quality"" sunscreens (like Livestrong), and this one definitely rubs in the best.  It's the only one I've gone back to.I also like that it comes out in a push top, which sets the perfect amount for me.  I bring it with me on hot days, and when I've used tubes in the past, hot sunscreen comes out by the gallon.  If I'm going to pay more for sunscreen I'm glad I don't waste it by accidentally pouring out half the tube in one use."," June 5, 2014"
429,Deadhead,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for acne prone skin!,"  So I waited a while to write this cuz I wanted to give it time. I really thought that after a week or two it would start to break me out, but that's hasn't happened. I have extremely acne prone skin, and usually sunscreen breaks me out no matter what kind it is. I'm so happy to finally have a sunscreen I can use. Also most sunscreen burns and stings my eyes. This doesn't do that either, and I put it on my eyelids and under eye area."," March 30, 2019"
430,Diana S ,5.0 out of 5 stars,No breakouts but not a fan of the smell!,"  UPDATE: Not sure what I was even referring to about when it comes to the smell anymore because either I got used to it or I was being odd because I don't smell anything anymore.I have oily acne-prone skin and I've always found most sunscreens too heavy especially since I put on makeup afterwards, but I couldn't NOT use SPF. After trying almost everything in local drugstores, I came across this one. After using it for a while, I am proud to say that I haven't had any new breakouts, my hyper-pigmentation from acne picking is almost faded away, and I just feel so more secure around the sun. Feels super lightweight and I wear it under my makeup and foundation. The only CON I have is that it has this smell, this smell I can't describe. It isn't strong, it isn't terrible, it isn't perfumy, but it's something I don't love either. Definitely nothing major though!"," January 6, 2014"
431,WaniCh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen for face,"  I have very sensitive skin. My derm didn’t recommend me to use this, but I like to try. I had tried many drug store brand and all irritated my skin. This sunscreen is very light, not oilly, not sticky, and work well with make up. I need to clean my face with micelle water(Bioderma) before cleanser(Cetaphil) since it feels like water resistant."," August 6, 2020"
432,NYCRev,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for sweaty face,"  This was a miss for me. I really wanted to like it, I tried.... If you have a face that easily sweats this sun protection is not for you. It's very easy to spread but I don't feel any moisturizing effect nor protection. My face gets sweaty easily and I feel like I sweat it off quickly (quicker than other sunscreen I had before). I spent an hour in the shade at the beach, I came home and my skin felt like I had no sunscreen on at all. Felt a little burnt. I had my kid's sunscreen on the rest of my body and those parts don't feel burnt."," August 15, 2021"
433,V. Walton,2.0 out of 5 stars,not so clear,"  I purchased this because I have acne prone skin, but also because it is supposedly clear.  Not so much.  I have a somewhat dark complexion.  I don't wear makeup.  After putting this on, I have a gray cast to my face that can't be ignored.  I truly wish that I could find a good sunblock that doesn't turn me gray."," July 5, 2020"
434,Linda,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but good for your face,"  I have had skin cancer and a dermatologist recommended this product.  Works great.  Being a man, I didn’t want something that was visible, oily, greasy, or smelly.  This sunscreen is easy to apply, doesn’t smell, and you can’t tell you have it on at all.  I use it everyday for my face, ears, and neck."," July 1, 2021"
435,Jennifer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No sunburn, no breakouts!","  I've always had problems with breakouts on my face and chest with sunscreen, and I'll admit to poor compliance using sunscreen because of this. I've tried all the drugstore ""facial/sensative"" skin types and spent tons on Clinique, Clarins and even l'occitane, they all caused terrible breakouts! I did some research before my beach trip and found rave reviews on this, EltA MD. It's a mineral sunscreen  with  niacinamide and zinc oxide. It doesn't leave white residual and didn't feel heavy or greasy.  I used it 4 days in a row and NO BREAKOUTS!  My new favorite product and I had to share!"," February 26, 2019"
436,Andrea ,5.0 out of 5 stars,El mejor!!,"  El mejor protector solar que he ultilizado, anteriormente usaba la roche posey, pero mi dermatóloga me dijo este era una buena opción para piel mixta grasa, de gama alta y valía la pena. Decidí darle una oportunidad y la textura que deja es súper buena, siento mi piel muy hidratada sin dejarla grasosa. Es mi favorito ahora! Recuerda re aplicarlo cada 4 horas!!"," February 18, 2022"
437,BeachRabbit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't know how much protection yet,"  I recently had a face/neck lift with deep CO2 laser. My skin is now very red and hypersensitive. The plastic surgeon recommended this for sun protection. It is very easy to apply, moisturizing, and a little goes a long way. I hope never to be in the sun long enough to know if it is effective. But it's the first ting I put on daily before moisturizing and makeup."," December 15, 2019"
438,jgaustin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works!,  I am a redhead and need sunscreen every day. I live in Texas where the summers are sunny and hot! I absolutely love this sunscreen because I don't look like a ghost - covered in white zinc-based sunscreen! I've been looking for a product that keeps me from burning but goes on clear. This is the sunscreen that does all that! I have bought at least six bottles of this and will continue to buy this one for years to come!," November 5, 2018"
439,MW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product to protect dry skin.,"  This product is excellent, not only because it has a high protection but because it does not have any negative ingredients.  Definitely above the average sunscreen..  Highly recommend."," December 2, 2021"
440,Jennifer,5.0 out of 5 stars,great sunscreen,  I am an archaeologist and work outdoors often.  I like this sunscreen very much because it doesn't leave you greasy and it blends in quickly. There is no odor and I have not experienced any running of sunscreen into my eyes.  I am careful to apply in the morning before heading out into the sun and I don't get sunburnt throughout the day. We were given a bottle as a gift from the company and I liked it so much I bought some more once I ran out.," January 25, 2019"
441,B,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to spread on oily skin, doesn't mix well with moisturizer",  Heavy sunscreen smell and feel. Incredibly hard to spread on oily skin resulting in smeared sunscreen. Really disappointed that I paid so much for a sunscreen that I can't even apply to my face. They need to change the ingredients in this product.  I would not recommend this to people who have acne prone skin and oily skin.," April 23, 2019"
442,r.f.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product okay, Pump bottle TERRIBLE","  The bottle was terrible.  It arrived leaking (not a good package design for delivery to different climates, apparently) and it never worked right after that.  Some days, I would pump and pump and nothing would come out, then the next day it would work again.  The product is fine, but I'm giving it a very low rating because for a price like that there shouldn't be any struggle to get the product out of its packaging.  I was rather relieved when I finally ran out.  Then again, I'm not sure if I ran out or if the bottle just stopped pumping permanently.  :/"," May 26, 2015"
443,Amanda Donahue,5.0 out of 5 stars,GAME CHANGER,"  Okay this product is a game changer. I have melasma, which is dark skin pigmentation and using this everyday has helped SO much! I absolutely LOVE the lightweight and neutral scent (I hate the constant smell of sunscreen on my face). It’s spreads so smooth I only need a small amount. My skin is also so sensitive and I’ll breakout with anything new but if anything, this product has made my skin SO MUCH BETTER. I was super unhappy with how small the bottle was when I opened the package because it’s a rather big price tag but like I said, I use maybe half a pump for my whole face and neck and I will be rebuying for life."," May 8, 2020"
444,LLB17350,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good stuff!,"  This is the creamiest and smoothest sunscreen.  It feels like icing and goes on so smoothly with no stinky odor.  I do have to reapply every few hours if I'm out in the sun all day, but that is with most sunscreens.  It doesn't effect my rosacea prone skin.  I like it so much that have it on auto ship and will seeing what other kinds of products this company offers."," November 6, 2019"
445,Ajax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stellar sun protection for acne-prone skin!,"  My skin breaks out if you look at it wrong.  I can't wear any foundation except mineral foundation with only the basic ingredients.  And I cannot walk out of the house without a good sunscreen on my face.  Most are too heavy for my oily, acne-prone skin, and I've become more determined to avoid chemicals that my skin can absorb.  By accident, I stumbled across the website for Environmental Working Group (ewg.org) and saw their list of top environmentally safe sunscreens.  I promptly ordered EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46, and I found my Holy Grail of sunscreens.  Clear is lightweight, non-greasy, and doesn't make my face an oil slick by the end of the day.  It doesn't clog my pores, and my skin actually looks a little brighter.  Yes, it costs more than the drugstore brands, but not outrageously so.  And it's worth it."," July 5, 2011"
446,Keisha Dennis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sunscreen!,"  This product rubs in very well, it feels moisturizing, and I haven’t had any breakouts while using this. I don’t get a white cast with this sunscreen either and it works well under makeup. Only thing that I don’t like is the applicator, other than that good product."," December 6, 2019"

448,Samantha A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,  This is my go to sunscreen for my face. I have tried many others but this is the best. I wear it religiously every day. Helps with the the dark masking I get from the sun and hormones. Doesn't leave a residue on my skin.," June 7, 2021"

451,Alize Chudess,5.0 out of 5 stars,best sunscreen cram ever,"  It’s the best sunscreen cream I have ever used.

Can’t leave the house without it no matter if it’s a winter or a summer."," February 18, 2021"
452,Brittany,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen,  I hate wearing sunscreen. I’m pale and I burn so I should’ve worn it a lot more. I find the standard ones greasy and mineral ones kind of chalky. This one is neither. It’s like lite facial moisturizer. You can easily wear makeup over it. It’s doesn’t crease or cake up. It absorbs quickly. I wish I had worn this years ago and prevented all the dark sun damage spots I have on my face now.," August 21, 2021"
453,Ann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome daily sunscreen!!,"  I was sooo happy to find this sunscreen on Amazon - for much cheaper that I pay at my dermatologist!  It is made for acne-prone skin and has a broad spectrum SPF with a zinc oxide base.  I have had laser surgery on my face for melasma (skin discoloration/hyperpigmentation), and this is the sunscreen my dermatologist recommended to protect my face (because of the zinc oxide).  I use it daily - a thin layer after I put on my moisturizer, and I love it.  It is lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly.  It does make my face a little shiny afterwards (like my experience with most sunscreens), however I put on a little face powder after it has absorbed and that takes care of the shine.  Best of all, it does not cause my crazy skin to break-out.  It is not waterproof, however.  The pump dispenser is very nice, and even though I use this everyday, it seems to last a long time.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."," January 29, 2014"
454,Shawna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Medium to Dark Skin Tones Too,"  Best sunscreen I have ever used for my face!  Even with plenty of melanin you need a sunscreen and my skin is prone to burning now because of my allergy medicine.  That burning can also can lead to hyper-pigmentation from the damage.  I LOVE this product!  I have yet to find a sunscreen that not only protects my skin but does so without irritating it and causing an outbreak or worse makes me look like I am a character in a ritualistic ceremony of some sort.  (Those with  a significant natural born tan understand what I am talking about.)I put this on after my moisturizer, let it absorb and then follow up with my regular makeup routine for every day.  It actually has helped my skin improve and have a better glow.  I use it without makeup for going to the beach, etc.  I learned of this from a consultant at a dermatologist's office and I have stuck with it ever since.  I even have a few friends now using it."," August 23, 2015"
455,twinmama2012,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke me out in a rash,  I wanted to like this so much after reading the reviews- however it stung when I applied it and broke me out in a splotchy rash each time I put it on. I don’t have sensitive skin so I’m not sure what the issue is. It is very moisturizing and applied great but I just can’t use it.," November 29, 2020"
456,Pamela C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect. Only sunscreen I have ever liked!,"  I hated using sunscreen, but i still wore it everyday because im so pale. I have oily skin, and tend to break out in my chin, and mouth area. This sunscreen almost feels like a mousse, its so soft and it doesn't break me out or make me oily. I Love that it has niacinamide which was recommended to me to help with acne scars. It doesn't pill with any of my other face products, except with the Benefit Porefessional Primer, and i thought that maybe it was the silica, but this doesn't happen with my Smashbox Photo Finish Foundations Primer Light, nor does it happen with creamier primers."," June 15, 2016"
457,K. Duncan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Mineral Sunscreen Even If a Bit Pricey,"  I love the EltaMD line of mineral sunscreen products.  They are the lightest weight sunscreens I have found and soak in well.  They are not thick or goopy so they go on smoothly and work great under makeup.  i prefer the non-tinted version because I use it on my arms, hands and back of my neck.  I have found the tinted one will get color on my clothes so I have to be careful where I put it.  The only drawback is the price.  But with this, you get what you pay for."," March 7, 2017"
458,Robot,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not good under makeup,"  This is very emollient, spread-able sunscreen.  Comes out white, applied clear.  I like that one pump dispensing about 1/4 teaspoon of product which is the recommended amount for the face.  But this did not sit well under my Estée Lauder Double Wear.  I got patchy dots all over my skin where it separated.  Not cute.  And my previous sunscreens didn’t render that result.  I’ll be using this on my next and chest from now on."," April 17, 2019"
459,pteli78,5.0 out of 5 stars,good product for sensitive skin,"  my skin is really sun-sensitive. In the past, I have broken out into rash after using regular sunscreens (many brands)...this is little different. it gets absorbed quickly (but a little greasy - not unbearable though).  plus, didn't cause any rash. I will pay the price for the quality of this product."," June 10, 2019"
460,CT,1.0 out of 5 stars,Breakout Many Whiteheads,"  My daughter was doing very well with her acne treatment with Adapalene gel at beginning of May, but she broke out about 50 tiny whiteheads on her forehead alone after used the sunscreen for a few days. It has totally ruined her skin and the whiteheads have not cleared up after more than a month. We had to stop using Adapalene too because the sun sensitivity. The situation is breaking my heart and causing me severe depression. Be very careful to use the sunscreen if you are using Adapalene gel."," June 19, 2021"

462,Jen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for rosacea/sensitive skin,"  Love this lotion. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I have rosacea and naturally sensitive skin. This product doesn’t irritate me at all. Fairly lightweight, but does a decent job moisturizing. Would highly recommend for anyone with rosacea or sensitive skin, especially if you normally struggle with sunscreen products."," February 3, 2020"
463,Best reviewer in the world,5.0 out of 5 stars,New HG SPF for cystic acne prone skin!!!,"  This sunscreen is amazing, I use SPF daily and due to having extremely bad hormonal acne, I generally can only use mineral SPF. I had ran out of drunken elephant Umbra, and wanted something less pricy. The EltaMD applies like a dream, very smooth, silky, and lightweight. It doesn't leave a cast like many mineral SPFS and I have no issues with it pilling up under my foundation. It is fragrance free which is nice. This is my new HG of daily SPF. It has not irritated my acne at all! This product is far superior to prestige SPFs that I've used in the past. I will continue to purchase this product!"," January 26, 2017"
464,LAURA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Luxurious consistency,  Love the consistency I put a couple drops of vitamin c with it and apply it on my face and neck I love it you don't feel like you're wearing a plastic shield or cakey or anything like that it melts in nicely," June 25, 2021"
465,JenSarmiento,4.0 out of 5 stars,Rosacea is not an easy condition and getting a product to work and not ...,"  Rosacea is not an easy condition and getting a product to work and not irritate my skin was a must. First time that I use this sunscreen, I purchase it from my dermatologist. I decided to give Amazon a try and was not disappointed. I'm giving it four starts, because the one at purchase at my Dr.'s office was white and this one is a little on the yellowish side. It has not cause any issues so far, but I just began using it last week."," December 16, 2016"
466,alex morgan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Made my sensitive skin rash out,"  Heard this was great for sensitive skin, I did all my research therefore that’s why I purchased this item for a daily sunscreen wear.

I’m very sad this product didn’t work for my skin."," February 24, 2022"

468,Lauren Wilhelmy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love,  This is the holy grail of sunscreen. My dermatologist swears by this and I got my whole family hooked! It’s not oily and is easy to spread and use daily.

469,Jill Brailey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally a non greasy sunscreen!,"  I have hyperhydrosis (extremely excessive sweating) and oily skin with cystic acne on my chin. I don’t wear makeup or lotions because my face beads up constantly with sweat and my makeup looks horrible. I’ve been searching for a sunscreen that isn’t that yucky sticky greasy stuff that makes me a swampy mess and causes more acne. I was pleasantly surprised when I applied it and found it light, creamy and not even a tiny bit sticky! It even smells good! I test drove it all afternoon, grocery shopping, cooking over a hot stove and I felt perfect!  Not sure how the SPF is on me yet but I can definitely tolerate this stuff! If my sweaty face can stand it, I’m positive you can to!"," January 24, 2020"
470,Io5875,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is really bad,"  I have used Elta md before so I don't know what's going on. But this is awful. It leaves a white cast all over: your cheeks, your eye brows, your nose area. And it's soo awful with moisturizing. I wonder if I got the fake? I don't know. But days after, I have scale like rashes on my face. Please stay away."," November 17, 2021"

My dermatologist recommended this to me during breakouts, but I use it every day. I have one in every bag that I own.Goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly-- it actually feels good to put it on! Under makeup or by itself, it's been a lifesaver for me. It has really made my skin look better because it helps calm redness.Also, if you are one of those people who breakout whenever you use sunblock, use this one!! Regular sunblock clogs me up (even the kind that say they don't), and I have never had a problem with this one. Bonus: it actually does protect you from sunburn!"," December 29, 2013"
473,Rheya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skin type,  New favorite sunscreen! I was using paulas choice for years but this sunscreen is amazing. I have combo acne prone skin with rosacea. My skin is so sensitive and sometimes during my skin imbalances it stings to apply sunscreen but NOT with this one. It’s moisturizing without looking greasy. I get a nice glow with no white cast. It doesn’t make my makeup slip off and is a nice base. Love this sunscreen.," July 15, 2021"

I have very oily and prone acne skin , i had always been afraid of putting any type of cream or lotion on my skin with the fear of it making my skin even more oily ! However this product does not do that. The picture of me is having the sunscreen on for 4+ hours and is a bit glowy which is normal, i wear it with makeup and has no white cast, i have been using for the last year and have never switched up , the only reason i don’t give it 5 stars is because it lasts me about a month , i have the subscription and finish it before i get the new one"," April 25, 2021"

476,Eliza Walsh,2.0 out of 5 stars,My sensitive skin reacted poorly,"  I bought this because it is touted as highly recommended for sensitive skin and redness. However, I had a terrible reaction to it. The second day I put it on, my face immediately felt itchy and hot and raw, like a sunburn. It took a good week or so for it to heal. I patch tested this on my arm and thigh and had no reaction, but after my face calmed down, I patched it behind my ear and showed irritation within 24 hours. Maybe it doesn't play nice with a different product I use but either way, I'll be giving it to a family member who can use it."," January 10, 2021"

478,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go-to sunscreen!,"  This is my forever go-to sunscreen. It was originally recommended to me by my dermatologist as my skin is on the oily side.

479,BarbarainAustin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not the same product,"  I have used the EltaMD UV Broad Spectrum sun block for many years, primarily purchasing it from dermatologists offices.  I do not think the product I received was the same product I have used in the past.  The Amazon product was a thin, yellow colored fluid much more like a hand lotion than the white, thicker creme that the usual Elta product is like.  I went to a dermatologist and bought a new EltaMD and threw away my Amazon product.  I would not buy this product again and I would suggest that Amazon look into their supplier."," January 25, 2018"

481,Ally_OnTheRoad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Face Sunscreen,"  I have fairly normal skin but get occasional breakouts if the product I use is oily. This sunscreen is very light and I like that it's just a straight up sunscreen, nothing else. I put it on after I've done my morning moisturizer and it lasts a long time. I recently went on an island vacation and it was perfect for every day use there (I use it every day normally anyway!). Really good stuff and I'll definitely buy again!"," January 29, 2019"

483,Victoria Nguyen,3.0 out of 5 stars,I wish this could work on my skin. :(,"  I wished this work for me because I hear a lot of good reviews. The constancy is a little bit, by a hair, like a sunscreen, but it goes on very light and does not leave a white cast on my asian skin tone. I do not know if this product will leave a white cast on darker skin tone though. Unfortunately my skin is not fond of sunscreen in general, and sadly it rejected this one to. It is still a good sunscreen if anyone doesn't have problem with sunscreen. It does have that sunscreen smell to it, but not extremely potent. I advice anyone with normal to dry skin to wear a moisturizer under."," June 15, 2017"

I don't like the feel of sunscreen so I struggle with it but this is very light and feels nothing like sunscreen. I first bought it at my dermatologist he highly recommended it. It has really helped with my flare ups and I always see this brand at different dermatologist office so I know its a good brand.," October 23, 2018"
487,Marx's,2.0 out of 5 stars,I might have gotten a bad bottle,  This stuff smells terrible! It is a strong machine oil smell that wafts around my face all day. It makes me sick. It does go on smoothly and hasn't made me break out.," December 17, 2021"
488,Ramon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sunscreen for darker skin tones!,"  I had been struggling to find a good sunscreen that didn't leave a white cast. Other sunscreens I've encountered that go on clear are irritating, greasy and/or contain fragrance (and expensive to boot). This is none of those things! It was actually recommended to me a while back, but I was reluctant to order it because of the reviews of it being phony, and because the zinc oxide in it made me worry it would leave a cast (since I'm brown skinned). Turns out Amazon is a legitimate vendor of Elta Md products and upon trying it, I found that it's  a bit white when applied but goes clear when rubbed in, and dries with absolutely no white cast. Couldn't be happier!"," March 1, 2019"
489,Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,"BB cream, fixes problems looks and wears great.","  Balanced my oily skin and moisturized dry areas. Created a lovely natural look or a great base for most makeup.

490,holli redekop,5.0 out of 5 stars,works well - no breakouts,"  My dermatologist sold this - I bought it first at her office but now I just order it online. I can spend all day in the sun and feel protected - although I do reapply on my nose. It does not show white like other effective sunscreens (lower zinc level maybe)? It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. So so much better than the drugstore versions and hey, it's your face - its worth it."," May 6, 2020"
491,Ashley Y.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome for acne prone skin,"  This has to be the best sunscreen for the face I've ever used. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin that is very easily agitated. I am also a fair skinned red head that is easily sunburned. A lot of products can break me out. I tried the facial sunscreen by Neutrogena for acne prone skin, and it made me an absolute oil slick. It also did break me out. I got this after doing some research and seeing the high reviews, and I can definitely see that they were not exaggerating. It does not break me out or cause any excess oil. I wear it all day while my son is playing ball and no burn or oil! It is a bit expensive, but for me it's worth it. Will definitely buy again."," April 21, 2015"
492,NerdsAreSexyy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product,"  For rosacea, SPF is so important, but it's been so hard to find a sunscreen that doesn't break me out.

493,Angelique Seitz-Peña,5.0 out of 5 stars,I recommend it,"  I have super sensitive acne prone skin, as well as super dry/combination skin. I am amazed that this product didn’t break me out!

499,Stephanie Sanchez,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good,"  I do not recommend. This sunscreen turns into little balls, pills. End up having to use a towel to wipe off, which I’m sure is just so much wasted product. Feel like I’m so unprotected because of the pilling. Never have experienced a sunscreen that does this. Even with waiting before applying any makeup, it just does not absorb well into skin. Save your money and skip this one."," August 23, 2021"

503,dianne_uhh,4.0 out of 5 stars,favorite sunscreen ever!,"  I have very acne prone, sensitive and dry skin which is ultimately one of the worst combinations for skin ever. However, this sunscreen really helped out with protecting my skin over time. It didn't irritate my skin at all, and there is very minimal white-cast when applied. All the ingredients are great especially for protecting acne prone skin. One of the things I don't like however is that it's not water resistant, and if you don't reapply at least every two hours when you're out in the sun, you will most likely get little but still some sunburns. So four stars"," December 19, 2019"

I have rosacea, sensitive skin and lots of hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, neck and upper chest.  It is imperative that I use a good sunscreen every day to help fade the pigmentation problem and to protect from further damage.  I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen.  It feels a bit like a moisturizer, which I usually hate, but it is not greasy and it dries really quickly.  I am thrilled to be able to use this under foundation, which always felt too heavy before.  I am so happy with it that I signed up for automatic delivery on Amazon to make sure I never run out."," October 10, 2019"

Then to open it and find that the box had been crushed or mishandled led to further suspicion. Upon further investigation, I found that some of the sunscreen had been pumped inside the lid. I no longer feel comfortable with applying this to my face as it seems to have been tampered with. Unfortunate, since it was 33$ that I probably won't get back."," February 23, 2019"

I put it on Monday night before bed and noticed the rash Wednesday morning. If you do get and have sensitive skin make sure to do a patch test.," March 10, 2022"
518,Rebecca,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,"  I don’t normally write reviews on products, but this one is well worth it. I’ve tried many different fave sunscreens and this is the first that I feel I look forward to using every day. It’s smooth, has a nice, light pleasant scent, doesn’t leave a white cast, and is protecting. I love it!"," May 16, 2020"
519,BubblyH20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for Sensitive Rosacea-Prone Skin,"  I love the entire Elta sun line, but this product is lightweight and effective at keeping my sensitive skin from breaking out or getting burned. I use the heavier, physical barrier sunscreen in the summer when more protection is needed."," December 21, 2020"
520,Kay Snowe,2.0 out of 5 stars,Shiny skin but also dry?,"  Honestly this was a pass for me. I know a lot of people love this. It made my skin look really shiny/greasy, but at the same time it dried my skin out like crazy. I used it in winter so maybe I'll give it another shot in the summer when it's more humid. I didn't break out though, so it gets a star for that."," February 23, 2020"
521,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive and acne prone skin,"  Product is fabulous.....shipper/seller not so much.  I love this product so much, I added to my subscription but this month's product came already opened and I was worried about using the products as a result."," February 17, 2020"
522,Stephanie,3.0 out of 5 stars,Came spilled,"  Still haven't tried as I just received it, so I can't speak for the sunscreen itself, but the bottle came with sunscreen spilled all over the cap. It's a shame. I'll update on the sunscreen itself after I use it for a while."," December 1, 2021"
523,Demetrio,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Smells different than before, hope that is not an issue.","  For some reason my most recent purchase of this exact item has a different smell than my prior ones. Not sure if the formula changed or what so I am a bit weary. Hopefully it works the same, time will tell."," March 23, 2021"
524,Elizabeth Anguiano,1.0 out of 5 stars,Allergic Reaction,"  I developed an allergic reaction to this sunscreen. I noticed my face was extremely dry to the point it felt scaly the day after I used the sunscreen. By the second day, I developed a rash on my neck. I bought my mom the same sunscreen and she didn’t experience any reactions. Try this at your own risk!"," May 28, 2021"
525,J Montenegro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daily sunscreen convert,"  Trying to pick up the habit of applying sunscreen daily is a chore.. especially for someone like me, who genuinely doesn't care and is happy to slap on some jojoba each morning and call it a day. I picked this up based on raving recommendations from two trusted sources, and now that it's summer wanted something for the beach.Man. Goes on SUPER smooth and clear. No residue, no film. Has the refreshing scent of a clean summer poolside. I unexpectedly love it.Sunscreen is no longer just ""a beach thing"" -- I am now officially a daily facial sunscreen kinda gal. At least until this bottle runs out. Which it might, soon."," July 31, 2015"
526,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen!,  Great sunscreen. Leaves a tiny little bit of white cast - not much though compared to other sunscreens. This isn’t a full mineral sunscreen though. Works for my super sensitive normal to dry skin.," April 30, 2021"
527,lw59614,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just wish it wasn’t so expensive,"  This is a great facial sunscreen. Doesn’t leave a white cast, or break me out. It feels like a typical moisturizer. It has a slight sunscreen-like scent, but it’s not strong and it fades quickly.I just wish it wasn’t so expensive, but luckily one bottle seems to last awhile."," May 13, 2021"
528,P.P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,  Non-greasy. It is an easy way to start wearing sunscreen regularly.  The only facial sunscreen that doesn't cause breakouts. It is also very moisturizing.," January 27, 2022"
529,Maple dumfries,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's very light and doesn't turn you skin white like other sunscreen,  Product works as expected.  It's very light and doesn't turn you skin white like other sunscreen.  I have combination skin and dont have any problems wearing this under my makeup everyday.  My major complaint is that the pump design sucks.  99% of the time it does not work and/or delivers a tiny amount.  I read on another review that this problem could be solved if you store the bottle updside down.  Tried that and it's true...pump will work as intended if it's stored upsode down.  But the problem with that is some product leaks out of the bottle.  Overall i like the product but the pump is annoying to deal with.  For this reason i will not re-purchase.," July 27, 2015"
530,Ad,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen!,  I used to use supergoop sunscreen however it has avobenzone which makes my blonde hair turn orange. This sunscreen is moisturizing and not have a white cast and I have olive skin. It’s extremely hard to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave my skin looking grey . Extremely moisturizing and feels so light weight I wish I got it sooner!," June 22, 2021"
531,Lexi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisturizer for sensitive reactive skin,"  I have sensitive skin, rosacea and hormonal acne.  Most sunscreen moisturizers are irritating or leave a white residue - not this one.  If you have problem skin, I highly recommend the Elta MD clear.  No breakouts!"," January 25, 2020"
532,Alex Spencer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite of all time,  This is my favorite face sunscreen of all time. I’ve tried using other brands but none seem to work as well and also stay put on my face like this one. I’ve had issues with face sunscreens running into my eyes if I get sweaty/wet on my face from being outside but this one never does. It also never breaks me out and I’ve had issues with others doing this. Overall 10/10 would recommend!!!," September 21, 2021"
533,Arz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for sensitive skin!,"  I bought this product because of I read many good reviews about it , but it is not for sensitive and oily skin. After I started to use it I have whiteheads on my face. And they lost my first package or didn’t send it and replaced for other product waste of time !"," July 23, 2020"
534,Mahara,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin,"  Loved this product, gands down. I have sensitive skin. Covered well. Feels light on the skin ,smells nice. Offered protection.  Highly recommend and will purchase again."," September 11, 2021"
535,Shea LaFountaine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"  I’m very pleased with this product! It feels great on my skin, not greasy at all, and works well for sun protection.  The only thing I dislike is that it seems to have a faint almond scent which is not my favorite scent but it’s still a great product."," September 5, 2020"
536,avidbuyer123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good sunscreen,"  I really like this sunscreen, one of my favs out of the 10+ I have tried so far. Rubs in like a moisturizer and is not as greasy as some others. Feels very lightweight. Does have a bit of a strong perfume scent that lasts about 30 or so minutes so if you are very sensitive to smell this might not be right for you."," January 5, 2022"
537,K. M. Schmit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Protection that works!,"  My dermatologist recommended this product. OK, I guess I'll try it. I first purchased the product directly from my dermatologist' office. I was surprised! It's not greasy, blends easily into your skin, and leaves your skin soft. I have ordered several bottles since then (through Amazon), and will continue to order more, as soon as my current bottle is finished. I love this product, and highly recommend it to other family members and friends."," June 18, 2018"
538,C.D.S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended by my Dermatologist...,  I use this brand recommended by my Dermatologist. It is a must have since skin cancer surgery. It protects well and is gentle on my sensitive skin. It does not burn my skin as some sunscreens can. Very soothing.," March 19, 2021"
539,Katrina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best face sunscreen! Ever!,"  I LOVE this sunscreen.  I have melasma (hyper-pigmentation) on my face that gets darker in the sun.  I bought this before meeting with a dermatologist, and when I told her which sunscreen I was using, she told me it's her favorite and the one she recommends to her patients.It's light and rubs in easily and doesn't have an offensive smell.  Make up goes on smoothly over this sunscreen. I have pretty sensitive skin when it comes to sunscreen on my face, but this one caused no breakouts and kept me sunburn free all summer.  It's a little pricey, but as I used it only on my face, it lasted for awhile.  I definitely recommend this sunscreen, especially if you have melasma or other hyper-pigmentation issues on your face!"," November 6, 2013"
540,Susan,1.0 out of 5 stars,... was recently diagnosed with mild rosacea and needed a good daily sunscreen,"  I was recently diagnosed with mild rosacea and needed a good daily sunscreen. After just a few days of using this, my cheeks became irritated, rough, dry and scaly, and the rest of my face was just dry. I've stopped using it and my skin is just about back to normal a week later. My skin is normally quite oily- I've never had a reaction like this to a lotion. From reading the rest of the reviews it sounds like some people react poorly to the niacinamide. I'll steer clear of it in the future. I'm now using a moisturizer with SPF from Juice Beauty and it's awesome!"," June 19, 2017"
541,Rainbow in the Dark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light and layers well with makeup.,"  I was frustrated with my dermatologist's recommended SPF lotion that left my face an oil slick, so I read things on the google and decided to try Elta MD.  It is amazing- there is no grease pooling on my skin and my makeup doesn't get weird."," December 6, 2019"
542,Margaret,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen,"  Dermatologist recommended to me (I have very sensitive skin) use it all the time! Goes on smooth, not greasy, absorbs into your skin instantly, don’t feel it that it is on you."," August 18, 2021"
543,Terri G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best SPF ever,"  Best SPF ever!! I have been using this product for a couple of years now and don's see myself using anything different. Other products would either make my face oily or make me break out but this one is on of a kind. The 1.7 oz bottle lasts me close to two months and I religiously use it daily, sometimes twice a day even when I reapply before hiking/running. Yes, it is on the high end just for SPF you may think - but anything for your face is an investment in my personal opinion and this one is well worth it!"," January 9, 2018"
544,",Vicki Moore",5.0 out of 5 stars,My perfect daily facial sunscreen.,"  This moisturizing sunscreen was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I’ve been using it for over 3 years and have yet to find anything better. It blends easily and I’ve even had my son use it because it helps his acne prone face. I am in my late 40s with combination skin. I use it with extra moisturizer in the winter sry months, but in the summer, it’s all I need under my makeup. It also layers nicely over my lighter serums."," January 6, 2021"
545,pockypore,3.0 out of 5 stars,"good stuff, but expensive",  very very light and moisturizing. I run 5 days a week and I am usually coveted in zinc that stays white ( even tho package says clear) and it is like glue to get off after my run. this product not like that. I also am allergic to many many sunscreen products. I did not experience any breakouts or rash.  I have very sensitive  skin so if you fit that criteria  you may wish to try this.  holding back 2 stars because this is way too expensive. especially if you need to use every single day like I do for my run.," September 2, 2016"
546,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caused dry skin and acne breakout.,"  This product dried my skin out very badly. Then my skin broke out after using this for 2 days in a row.  I didn’t get burnt while in the sun, but it definitely isn’t suitable for sensitive skin... in my opinion. I’m disappointed in this product considering the cost of it!"," June 22, 2019"
547,Christine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Elta Md Sunscreen for rosacea and acne prone skin,"  I have used everything for my skin which after I became ill looked like someone else's skin, so very dry.. The elta Md daytime moisturizer with this fabulous sunscreen, recommended by my dermatologist, using them together night and day has made my skin look like I am 10 years to 15 years younger, than my age, again. It is the best. Thankyou Elta md."," August 3, 2019"
548,J. Snoz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very light strong SPF,"  This was recommended by my dermotologist as a non-pore-clogging SPF for daily wear. It is very light and you only need to use a very small amount. I can't be sure about the coverage, but I do know that I do not break out like I do when I put other sunscreens on my face - even ones designed for face."," January 30, 2020"
549,Rosanne S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Product is great, How it arrived not great.","  This product is high quality and works extremely well. I had purchased two, one to use now and the other for use after the first ran out. Today I opened the 2nd box and found that the lotion had dispersed into the cap either at the factory or during transit. Unfortunately, it’s past the date for returns. All I’m suggesting is to open the packaging to check for damage. This is a spendy product and well worth it but the loss was unfortunate."," March 19, 2022"
550,Yona park,5.0 out of 5 stars,Always works for my skin,"  I don't like using the same product always even though it works, I just like trying different, new products. But, this sun screen, I can't resist continuously using this. Since I have a very fair skin with tendency of easily getting light brown sun spots, I can not live even a day without a sun screen especially in SoCal.It is so important for me my sun screen is not heavy, not scented, and not oily. I prefer my sun screen to be light but with a high spf in broad spectrum protection so I can wear it under makeup, or constantly reapplying through out a day when hiking, or simply wear it as a day time moisturizer comfortably."," February 27, 2015"
551,rachel lehman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not waterproof,  I bought this product because I've been searching far and wide for a sunscreen for my sensitive face that won't cling to the dry skin around my mouth and nose. I thought I had found it. Until it sweated off and I got quite sunburned. What good is this if I have to also put a water/sweat resistant sunscreen over top? No thanks. I'll keep searching.," July 27, 2019"
552,B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only sunscreen that DOESN’T burn eyes,  Highly recommend. I was looking for a sunscreen that doesn’t burn my eyes and this works perfectly. Used for a beach vacation. Liked elta for the face and sun bum for the body.," June 10, 2021"
553,TipsyKibbles,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, just not for my crazy skin.","  I’m sure this is amazing but it broke me out. That doesn’t speak for the product though, I have the most sensitive skin in the universe and break out from a lot of things. It was very moisturizing so I liked that about it. Give it a try and I’m sure you will love it."," September 24, 2020"
554,Heather Tweito,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where have you been all my life?!,"  I was always told when growing up to wear sunscreen every. single. day. But did I listen? No. Putting sunscreen on my face always resulted in a greasy white film that caused break outs and poor makeup results. Now that I’m in my late 30s I have sunspots, so I figured better late than never. Where was this sunscreen when I was younger?! It’s amazing. No white cast, no oily residue...I wear it every single day. It truly is an amazing product that I can’t tell enough people about."," September 16, 2020"
555,ATN,5.0 out of 5 stars,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product","  I LOVE this product.Even in my early 30s, my skin is prone to breakouts. Most moisturizers leave me feeling greasy. Not so with Elta. It leaves my skin feeling dry and smooth and, best of all, protected. At trisk of sounding overdramatic, it's actually a joy to put on.I've been using this product for over a year upon the recommendation of my dermatologist and I've told so many friends about it.The sunscreen really works too. Just yesterday I spent all day at a fair. I put this on as a part of my morning routine, but forgot to put sunscreen anywhere else. My shoulders are rather burnt, but my face and neck show no signs of sun."," October 25, 2015"
556,c michelle rodriguez,3.0 out of 5 stars,The lotion is great but the packaging and the pump on the bottle constantly stops working.,"  I love this product and give the lotion all the stars! BUT my issue is with the packaging. I would say, every other time I use a new bottle - the pump/applicator breaks shortly after opening and it no longer pumps out lotion which leaves me with a useless bottle that I can't get lotion out of. This has happened multiple times and is so frustrating. I usually have to remove the entire pump applicator and resort to accessing the lotion that way which sucks. Again, i love the content but wish the bottle and applicator were more efficient and useful."," June 5, 2019"
557,TheRealVanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product; UVA & UVB protection,"  I’ve used this for 5-6 years.  Absorbs well into the skin, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause blemishes, and works well under makeup.  It has UVA and UVB protection.  Product has a pump dispenser, and it cannot be left in the heat or the plug at the bottom disintegrates, causing the not to work anymore.  Good sized bottle.  EltaMD makes a clear formulation, too, but it is much more expensive, so I stick with this one."," January 22, 2018"
558,Lady V,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not only does it protect your face... its silky and,"  The best sunscreen I’ve ever used. It not only protects my skin, but it softens my face. I’ve been using this sunscreen for several months and I’ve noticed that my freckles have lightened!"," June 11, 2021"
559,JudyC,5.0 out of 5 stars,The bomb,"  I love this product.  Effective sunscreen, no typical sunscreen smell, and—unlike other sunscreens—no burning and stinging if it accidentally gets in your eyes.  Also does OK under makeup, with no greasy feel."," September 18, 2021"
560,Ajax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for sensitive skin,"  Sunscreen tends to irritate my skin but this stuff doesn’t. It does go on a little pale when you initially apply it, given that it’s a mineral sunscreen, but not noticeably so. I can’t speak to its moisturizing capabilities since I apply it over my regular moisturizer. Overall I’m very pleased and I chose this product after a lot of research."," July 18, 2019"

562,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen out there,  I have used plenty of different brands but this one is by far the best- feels lightweight and no greasy residue. Recommended by my dermatologist. Will be my new go-to sunscreen for my face.," August 31, 2021"
563,Polly M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Newly Devoted to this Sunscreen,"  I’d heard about this sunscreen for quite a while and finally decided to start using a separate sunscreen rather than a moisturizer/sunscreen combo. After using it for a couple weeks I can say I love it! The feel is smooth and velvety and doesn’t leave any traces of white on my face. It blends in beautifully, feels light and leaves a nice finish on my face. I’ll be ordering again."," June 27, 2020"
564,JP,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but deceivingly large container,"  I really like this sunscreen, it doesn't break me out and has a nice lightweight formula that spreads nicely.However, there is a false bottom on the container. I was curious how far up the true bottom was so I stuck this piece of lead up a small hole on the false bottom.I extended the piece of lead as far as I could and it STILL doesn't reach the true bottom.So just keep in mind that this is 1.7 oz and the container is unnecessarily large. Otherwise great product."," July 6, 2020"
565,JKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not made in China!,"  This is my favorite sunscreen and I have used it for years. Although my skin is on the dry side, it feels nice going on and wears well under makeup. I was going to reorder and noticed that it stated ""Country of Origin-China"" so I called the company and was told that it is made in Carrollton, Texas, as I had believed all along. This sunscreen is fantastic, as well as all the EltaMD products I have used, which are many.A++++"," September 27, 2021"
566,Chris P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen for my face,"  I obsess about sunscreen, and I am completely satisfied with this one. I have sensitive skin and I burn really easily. It lasts a lot longer than anything else I've used. It FEELS good going on. No shine, residue, or sting. I use moisturizer on top of it, then makeup. I am going to keep buying it and that is extremely high praise from me. Absolutely great."," June 20, 2019"

568,Desiree,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great moisturizer/sunscreen for oily prone people.,  I bought this after suffering from a massive breakout due to a foundation reaction. I needed a light moisturizer/sunscreen that absorbed quickly and didn't clog my pores. I was intrigued by the other reviews for this this that claimed this lotion tones down redness. Indeed it does! After a few weeks of use my breakouts have subsided (I don't credit that to this lotion though) and my normally red face looks more balanced after I put this on. I love that it's an spf 46. My skin doesn't look oily or shiny after I put this on. And it moisturizes just enough to help smooth my skin before applying powder. I will continue to purchase this as long as the price is reasonable.," October 10, 2013"
569,Travelbuzz,5.0 out of 5 stars,The real stuff,  Someone wrote a review saying that this was a knock off... via the date. I didn't buy it worried. Then a few weeks later I was like WTH... bought it. Has the date on the bottom. Not sure if it's a knock off but it works great. Everything I use EXCEPT this product gives me massive zits on my face and neck. THIS DOES NOT.," October 5, 2019"
570,KK,1.0 out of 5 stars,This made me break out in hives,"  I cannot believe this sunscreen gets good reviews. It's marketed as being for sensitive skin. Well, I have sensitive skin, and it made my skin break out in hives. Looking at the ingredients, I believe it is the octinoxate that made me have a bad reaction. This is an ingredient that a lot of people react to. Really think this product should be off the market!"," January 27, 2022"
571,sea,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for me, not enough zinc oxide","  I'm disappointed with this sunscreen but to be fair my skin is sensitive and very oily.  If the oil remains unchecked, I get severe acne, the kind that are bigger than a quarter and don't come up to the surface for weeks.  My skin has always been sensitive and this doesn't seem to prevent me from turning into a cherry.  Also, since the sunscreen is somewhat moisturizing, in combination with my oily skin, my makeup won't stay in place.  Booo!  Unfortunately my last sunscreen was BurnOut with 18% zinc oxide, but they changed the formula and now it is too oily.  I'll try adding zinc oxide to my makeup and hope that works!"," August 23, 2014"

573,Yolia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good for one layer sunblock only.,  What I like about this product is how smooth it feels when you apply it on my skin.

I like that it is not a matte finish and therefore gives a refreshed look to the skin.  I've been using this sunscreen for years. I highly recommend it.," July 2, 2020"
585,S. C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen you’ll ever own!,"  This is by far the best of the best! It’s not only recommended by dermatologist but also facial experts! It’s light wear, goes on really easy and doesn’t have a sunscreen smell. More of a medicinal one but that’s because of the zinc. I absolutely love this stuff!!"," November 3, 2020"
586,S. griffith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sent Tinted when order placed for and picture showed CLEAR. 😢,  Sent me tinted instead of the “clear” I ordered. By the time I needed to use it it was too late to return it. Mistakes get made. It’s part of life. Just be sure to check yours as soon as you get it or you’ll be stuck with a pretty expensive sunscreen you can’t use. 😢," June 11, 2021"
587,Elina Gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best moisturizer for sensitive and/or acne skin.,"  This is by far the best oil free high SPF moisturizer for those with sensitive and/or acne-ridden skin, and I have tried dozens over many years. It's light yet deeply moisturizing, without any white tint that you get from some sunscreens. When you first put it on, for a few seconds there is the faintest white-ish tint which disappears within about 10-15 seconds. Moreover, the SPF is very high, which is hard to find in light oil-free moisturizers -- usually you have to pick between light with low spf and heavy with high spf. This gives the best of both worlds. Plus, I don't have to wear any primer over it for daily makeup use, as makeup sits on top of this moisturizers evenly and the moisturizer acts as a bit of a primer. However, for special occasions or long sunny days, I can still put primer on top of this moisturizer without any issue. After it dries, it's as though there is nothing on your skin."," December 20, 2015"
588,Stacy S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for sensitive skin,"  I loved the feel of this product on my skin. It spread easily and didn’t leave a white cast. But it did leave my face looking greasy.After 2 days I noticed that the skin on my face had a bumpy texture and it was itchy, red, and puffy. I have sensitive skin so I wouldn’t recommend for anyone else who does either."," February 27, 2021"
589,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Significant white cast on women of colour.,"  This product has glowing reviews but most seem to leave out the fact that this WILL leave a white cast on persons of colour. I am Asian and of medium to dark skin tone and it leaves a significant white cast. It cannot be worn alone and must be covered with makeup. So while it may be suitable for fairer skinned people, people of colour need to be mindful of this which is something I wish I knew before I bought it. Also I live in a humid climate and the sunscreen does not go on matte and is actually pretty greasy. But this may be due to my climate so might be better in colder climates. I was disappointed in this product. Pros include the fact that it doesn't make me break out and sits nicely on the skin. But all in all I would not repurchase. Dermatologica does a sunscreen that actually goes on clear and I would go back to that instead"," January 19, 2018"
590,Stephanie McKenna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best face sunscreen ever!,"  Holy cow I have never found a sunscreen as much as I love this one! No thick white film! This rubs in SUPER easy, works fantastic (no burns for me yet!), hasn’t triggered any breakouts from my crazy congestion prone skin, and helps keep my skin moisturized! I really cannot go without this stuff. If you’ve been looking for the perfect face sunscreen then this is it!"," June 14, 2020"
591,mcls,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this sunscreen,"  It is not tinted so you have to mix with foundation. It feels light and not greasy. It is my favorite sunscreen, although expensive to use as liberally as I do."," April 8, 2020"
592,Alissa,3.0 out of 5 stars,Broke me out,"  HERE ME OUT. It’s a great product. It did NOT pill for me. Went on so smoothly. Did NOT leave a white cast. Was super light weight. Unfortunately it did break me out bc my skin is very temperamental. It does have a scent to it but it’s really light and I like it, it’s almost almondy? It would’ve gotten a 5/5 if I didn’t break out but it did so it gets a 3/5 from me."," December 10, 2021"
593,TwinMom13,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caused cystic acne,"  Not sure this is the real one . I recommend buying straight from the dermatologist. I developed a horrible reaction 24hrs after, horrible acne on my face and neck where I applied it. The sample I received from my dermatologist did not cause this reaction."," September 24, 2021"
594,Nikki,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fair Skinned Texan,"  At age 24 with very fair skin, living in Texas, and doing a fair amount of commuting, I've already started to notice some lines in the morning on the left side of my face from sun exposure while driving. (!!!) With the sun being so intense here, I've been reluctant to go out  and garden or walk during the day without putting some icky yucky sunscreen on. A client of mine suggested this product, so I got it and I put it on every morning. I don't notice it all day, and I can now go outside without fear. :) It rubs in easily and actually moisturizes my dry skin. On the days that I choose to put a little makeup on, I can put it on almost immediately since it goes on so nicely."," November 21, 2013"
595,Kap,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use it every day!,"  I will use this everyday for the rest of my life!I was first recommended this by my dermatologist. I am allergic to oxybenzone found in most sunscreens (think: red hives all over my face and body.) On top of that, my sensitive skin will break out, even with the ""oil-free"" / ""won't clog pores!"" sunscreens.I use this under makeup and have no greasy feeling, which is rare for zinc oxide-based sunscreens.My tip: Pump onto fingertips and add a few drops of water before applying it to face. Make for a much smoother application."," December 31, 2015"
596,Miriam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Product,"  I love this product! I use it everyday for extra sun protection and it provides the best color tint. I pair this with the isle paradise tanning drops mixed with my moisturizer during the summer and I don't need any foundation, just spot correcting with concealer. Highly Recommend!"," April 24, 2021"
597,Jane Beck,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can see what the hype was about,"  Blends into my skin nicely, thin layer that isn't smelly or tacky or white, and my makeup stays on on top of it! No sliding or flaking off."," December 15, 2021"
598,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best face sunscreen EVER,  I have acne prone skin & this is by far the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. My dermatologist recommended this to me (along with a handful of my friends that use this) and I couldn’t be happier. It does NOT break me out in the least & is very lightweight.," May 16, 2020"
599,MNWalker,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best facial sunscreen!,  I have been using this product for over a year. I would never go back to anything else. I am very picky about facial sunscreens. I don't want to feel like I have anything on and it goes perfectly under any makeup. I also use it as my morning moisturizer and it lasts all day. I have recommended it to others who have also made the switch.," January 24, 2020"
600,Anson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sunscreen great. Bottle, less so.","  The cream seems great but there's a hole I'm the bottom which appears intentional, but when the bottle is placed upright, sunscreen pushes out of that hole."," June 23, 2021"
601,Rafael Bertot,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this sunblock!,"  This sunblock is excellent! It provides an excellent sun protection, it is easy to spread on your face and provides moisture to your skin without leaving your skin greasy. My dermatologist recommended  this product and I use it every day. I love it!"," June 17, 2021"
602,Mom of two boys,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for sensitive skin with rosacea.,"  I have very sensitive skin and recently developed rosacea. I haven't been able to use sunscreen on my face without it completely breaking out within a few hours of applying the sunscreen. Ulta MD has passed the few hour threshold. Though my face did get a ltitle irritated by the end of the day, the irritation was much less severe than with other sunscreens and, it does not last long. Definitely the best facial sunscreen I've used on my face in a long time."," July 2, 2018"
603,Lauren Gutierrez,5.0 out of 5 stars,The game changer to my daily routine,  This sunscreen works double as a bomb moisturizer before foundation application. I'm thoroughly obsessed. I've also noticed my skin looking clearer and smoother lately also. I think this will always be a part of my skincare routine!!," June 17, 2021"
604,N,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen protection ever!,"  It is my Only facial sunscreen since it came on the market: it gives fantastic protection, non-greasy and does not stain clothes. I have extremly oily skin that cannot tolerate so many otherwise good products but never had breakouts after months of using the Elta UV Sunscreen. Just apply 15-20 min before going out and re-apply as needed."," July 28, 2018"
605,Rosalind Robb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic and highly recommend.,  I am a firm believer in wearing sunscreen everyday not only for skin protection but for anti-aging.  This product is beautiful. Silky smooth and spreads easily with no white sheen or residue (great bonus for such a high SPF).  I love the pump.  Very little fragrance.  Added bonus of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) which is 'must have' ingredient has part of any skincare routine.  I will be buying this again.," September 23, 2017"
606,BO NA KIM,1.0 out of 5 stars,White flakes when applying second time,"  Honestly I wanted to like this stuff so much I tried all the way to 3 bottles and changed my moisturizers too thinking maybe it’s the moisturizers. No, this stuff makes weird white flakes when applying second time. (See the photo) I can’t just apply sunscreens once a day. Not going to use this anymore."," October 7, 2020"
607,Sharon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and perfect for my sensitive acne-prone skin,  It’s interesting how moisturizing face sunscreen can be. So far I haven’t had any redness or itchiness. Sunscreens are a hit and miss for me and this one is the perfect sunscreen I could find for my face!," June 29, 2021"
608,Elaine,4.0 out of 5 stars,High performance sunscreen,"  This is the only sunscreen I can use that won't make me break out. My dermatologist recommended it to me last year. It is very effective as a sunscreen... I took a trip to the British Virgin Islands last summer, and I applied the product to my face every morning before going out into the blazing sun. (My skin is fair and is prone to burning.) I found that the sunscreen lasted all day. I was basically at the beach everyday from 11 AM to 7 PM. I spent some time in the water, but I tried not to get my face wet. Of course water still got splashed on it anyway, but I didn't notice any effect on the sunscreen.One tip is to apply a thick coat, but make sure it gets absorbed.Also, I took off one star because it didn't give me as much moisterization as I was hoping for. Overall though, a wonderful product!"," November 26, 2015"
609,TW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not greasy and very light!,"  I love this product.  I am obsessed with sun care, but I hate the greasy heavy feeling of sunscreen on my face.  This is light, moisturizing and non-greasy.  It feels like an ordinary moisturizer and not a sunscreen.I am in my mid-40s, have combination skin."," March 2, 2020"
610,Sandya23,5.0 out of 5 stars,Daily Sunscreen,  I love this sunscreen. It’s easy to apply and doesn’t leave a white cast. I have normal to oily skin and it does not make it worse.I use it daily with or without make up.," July 28, 2021"
611,Kathlyn G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"  This is the best face sunscreen I have tried. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It is a little expensive, but worth it!! Not greasy and doesn’t stink. Rubs in completely,  no white left over residue."," November 17, 2020"
612,flowergal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good under makeup,"  This sunscreen is very light weight and blends in quickly. I am very fair and the high SPF is imperative to me but I am also prone to breakouts and am very careful with what I put on my skin. My friend recommended this product to me after her dermatologist recommended it to her. I am sort of on the fence with this one. I just got back from a week's vacation where I used this daily and definitely experienced a new breakout towards the end of the week. That said, I don't know if this sunblock was what caused it and I didn't get burned at all wearing this. It also leaves a faint white cast to the skin. I will continue to use intermittently and see what happens."," November 7, 2012"
613,Rachel Barkhorn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works nicely on sensitive skin in my experience,"  I have rosacea and this works well, doesn’t leave a white cast which I appreciate very much. I can say that this is pretty water resistant!"," July 16, 2020"
614,G. Host,5.0 out of 5 stars,The holy grail of sunscreen,"  I have tried so many products and continue to come back to this one. It has been the best for my skin.- It doesn't cause my already bad skin to break out.- It spreads evenly and doesn't leave a chalky residue.- Leaves my skin feeling hydrated.- No sting and smells rather pleasant (for sunscreen).I always make sure to keep a bottle of this in my back pack, another bottle at home, and another in my husband's car. He also likes Elta MD after I got him to try it. I hope you do as well!"," May 23, 2019"
615,FLO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sunblock that works,  Im sensitive to facial products a lot.  Like tis sunblock. Does not irritate my eyes when i accidentaly smear one to my eye," July 10, 2020"
616,Mine,5.0 out of 5 stars,best sunscreen ever,"  Best sunscreen I've ever used!I have sensitive skin and somewhat dry skin. Generally, if a sunscreen is moist enough, it burns; and if a sunscreen doesn't burn, it's not moist enough and it leaves white marks all around my face.This is the perfect solution. I will probably stick to it for my life"," September 15, 2020"
617,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality for even sensitive skins,"  My friend who has very sensitive skin and nuts to cosmetics recommended me this as she had been used this sun screen for a long time.Now I use this almost everyday as even primary before make ups.The texture is very smooth and light, so you don’t need to use so much amount at one time. Smell almost nothing but a bit sunscreen-ish (haha) as any of this kind of products.Overall I love this and will purchase again when I run out of current one."," October 20, 2018"
618,Danielle Marie,5.0 out of 5 stars,All-time Favorite,"  I have acne-prone skin and rarely leave reviews. I have to say that for someone who generally hates wearing sunscreen, wearing this has never felt like I was wearing sunscreen. It makes it far more enjoyable for me to apply this every day. No noticeable or unpleasant scent either. Buy it! I'm a believer."," October 21, 2019"
619,T. Gibbs,3.0 out of 5 stars,Like it...,"  I like this product; its one of the many sunscreens Ive tried that didnt burn the hell out of my skin. Its pretty thin compared to other screens Ive tried so I really like that, especially since I have naturally very oily acne prone skin anyway. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because, although its thin and not as coating, it would be much better if it had some type of oil mattifying ingredient such as the ""clean start"" matte spf 15 by Dermatolgica. Now I love that spf but its not strong enough for the protection I need. I continuously undergo an aggressive acne and exfoliating treatment, which occasionally includes; chemical peels, dermabrasion, lasers and etc. (not all at once and not close after one another of course).Anyhow...I would definitely recommend this product."," December 11, 2011"
620,Alexa’s,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Me encanto, lo volvería a comprar mil veces","  La única razón por la cual no le doy 5 estrellas es por la simple razón que ya no hacen shipping a Puerto Rico.  El protector solar es perfecto para mi sensible rostro,. Tampoco se siente pegajoso es liviano y me protege bastante para el sol de mi isla."," April 21, 2020"
621,Anne Braun,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best. Sunscreen. Ever.,"  Seriously. I live in Hawaii and must wear sunscreen daily. I also have skin that is subject to oiliness and breakouts. Wonderful. What's a woman to do? Wear the Eltamd UV Clear! This is the ONLY facial sunscreen that does not cause me to break out, become more oily, or feel sticky/greasy. I love it, use it daily, and buy it regularly. The sunscreen goes on silky smooth, very easy to rub in. My skin absorbs it easily and it actually helps even out my skin tone. I knew I had found a winner when I went to visit my dermatologist for my annual skin checkup and I saw that her office had started to carry the Eltamd sunscreen line! I also use this on my neck and the tops of my hands. What I also love about this sunscreen is the bottle it comes in: lightweight with a nice pump feature. But, the MOST important point is that this sunscreen works. Our summertime UV ratings are very high here and I never burn with this sunscreen on. That's saying a lot. Give it a try, especially if you're breakout prone. I don't think you'll regret it."," December 20, 2013"
622,Gretchen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good Sunscreen,"  I ordered this sunscreen after my dermatologist recommended it. I was hoping that it would be ""different"" from other sunscreens, somehow, because it's labeled ""UV Clear"" and that it's good for sensitive skin. Well, it honestly doesn't seem much different from any other sunscreen - I still feel like it gives me a bit of a pallor, and it feels no different from any other (I hate the feeling of sunscreen on my face). I'm giving it 4 stars because I do think it's a good sunscreen, and it IS on the EWG Safe Sunscreen list."," July 29, 2015"
623,Elizabeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Súper bueno para pieles grasas.....,"  Tengo mi piel súper grasa, y dude en ponermelo xq cuando lo pones en tus manos se siente como una crema normal, pero al aplicarlo en mi rostro se siente muy hidratante y súper fácil de disbuirlo ...

624,mascarasaurus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dermatologist's choice,"  Work at dermatologist's office, this is one of the most frequently recommended sunscreens to teens and adults. Lightweight lotion, helps keep breakouts at bay and keeps skin healthy. You'll see a slight blueish-white haze when you first put this on, that's a good thing, you want to see that zinc oxide & titanium dioxide sitting over your skin because that's what's protecting your skin from sun damage."," June 23, 2018"
625,worthwaitingfor,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t work well with other products,"  Bought this product based on other reviews, but I’m not impressed. It does not layer well as it “beads up” when trying to put any other product on top of it. Moisturizer is meant to be worn under makeup, but can’t because if the beading problem."," February 12, 2020"
626,Sunny Ng,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hands down, the best sunscreen I have ever purchased!","  As someone prone to acne, breakouts, and has had numerous procedures to try to fix his acne-scarred face, I have used Elta MD every single day. Even days that I don't go out. Not only have I never had a single breakout from this product, compared to others from brands like Neutrogena, but this product calms my skin and makes my scarring and redness less noticeable. This is an essential!"," April 14, 2020"
627,E. Condon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Blends in well, doesn't clog pores","  I was having a lot of issues with skin sensitivity and breakouts, but I have a job where I have to spend a lot of time in the sun. I switched facial cleansers (CeraVe), moisturizer (Eucerin), and started using this sunscreen all around the same time. This sunscreen goes on really smoothly, doesn't appear white like a lot of mineral sunscreens, and a little goes a long way. It has provided really good sun protection despite heat and sweat. And my skin has stopped breaking out! It's worth the price if you have sensitive skin!"," July 16, 2020"
628,Kenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this sunscreen.,  Dermatologist has recommended this and have used for years! I love the sun and this will stop me from getting my face burnt! All of these products work great! Highly recommended!," April 22, 2021"
629,Pen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,  I have sensitive skin and thought it was great but as the day go goes by I think I had slight irration.

630,Aimers,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,  Love that it soaks right in and doesn’t leave a white film. Nervous though because there was no safety seal on the box or bottle.," December 3, 2021"
631,Lobailey26,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,"  Hands down, the best spf. I used it on my face for a lake trip this weekend, and my face stayed my natural color, while my back and arms burned because I used another spf. My skin is acne prone and oily, but this product isn’t oily and gives my skin a good, flawless look after applying it.UPDATE: I think it’s a bit too dry for my combo skin, so I started adding a moisturizer under this."," June 24, 2018"
632,Sol,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my skin,"  Works wonders and does not clog my easily clogged pores.  Recommended because of my acne issues, and it protects my skin without adding to my problem."," June 3, 2021"
633,Maria,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok!,"  This is the only sunscreen lotion that does not sting my eyes even if it’s on the whole day and I put it directly on my eyelids. Not sure if it’s doing any moisturizing, and it does leave a white cast, but just because it doesn’t burn my eyes, it’s the only one that I will keep using."," September 29, 2021"
634,Shaina,1.0 out of 5 stars,Allergic reaction!,  This product is labeled to be for acne-prone skin (sensitive skin in general) and it caused me to break out super bad. It was not even a break out it was more of an allergic reaction similar to the other person that mentions this in the reviews. I returned it and I should have read the reviews before buying. I had used this product before and I'm not sure if they changed the formula or what's going on but I will never risk my skin with this product again.," November 17, 2020"
635,Louise de Windsor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I have ever used!,"  This is the FIRST sunscreen face lotion that works perfectly for my sensitive, fair skin.

636,DivaChalice,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best facial sunscreen with an adequate SPF I have found,"  I was recently diagnosed with melanoma I figured my daily SPF 15 sunscreen wasn't adequately meeting my sun protection needs. I have seen recommendations for EltaMD UV Clear sunscreen all over the internet and the final push was when my dermatologist recommended it. I am acne-prone and have a difficult time finding sunscreen that doesn't make me feel like I'm going to end up with a bunch of new breakouts. I am also partial to zinc oxide, a physical sunscreen, over other sunscreens because it soothes my skin. Overall, this sunscreen is absolutely worth a try if you have a difficult time finding a good facial sunscreen."," November 15, 2013"
637,Liv,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen I have ever used. I understand why its ranked so high,"  I was looking for a multi-faceted sunscreen that did not leave a white cast on brown skin. This is hands down the best,most lightweight, and moisturizing sunscreen. It does not leave a cast and applies smoothly. This sunscreen melts into your skin and has not broken me out. I am a fan and will repurchase"," May 17, 2020"
638,Linda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen for oily-prone skin,"  My dermatologist referred me to this to brand. Overall a great sunscreen for oily prone skin. I use it on my face when I know I am going to be out in the sun. It goes on very matte-like and you can add makeup right on top of that if you need to as well. I like that the dispenser dispenses just the right amount of product for your face and neck. I find it affordable for the product you get. For whatever reason sunscreen is expensive to begin with, so considering it is really  a specialty brand, the price is fair and in relation to drugstore brands. Only wish it was easier to find in stores. but always available on Amazon."," October 17, 2013"
639,PrincessRozebud,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight & Works,  This is my favorite light weight moisturizer. It’s important to have SPF and not be greasy or have a weird smell. This product delivers on all of those!," April 21, 2021"
640,J. Beecher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My favorite daily sunscreen for face - light, invisible, can be worn under foundation easily","  This is my favorite daily face sunscreen to wear under makeup. It is creamy and moisturizing but still lightweight. It blends easily onto the skin and it absorbs quickly. You can apply foundation directly over the top of it without waiting for it to dry and set. It does not cause my foundation to slip down. It doesn't make my face shiny. It doesn't irritate my skin. It doesn't feel heavy, it just feels like light moisturizing lotion. I use it every day under foundation. I had to return the first bottle I got because the pump was broken but the return was fast and easy."," May 18, 2015"
641,Kristen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked but now having a reaction,"  I purchased this and have been loving it, I’m not sure if the season change or just the product but now when I put this on my skin it burns, itches and I get red splotches all over my face. I tend to lean towards dry skin ans I haven’t changed anything in my routine. I’ve been using this for about 3 months with no issues. I used one full pump for my whole face and never noticed a white cast but I am fair skinned."," November 28, 2020"

645,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pay attention to your skincare ingredients,  Great suncreen been using it for years but look at the ingredients in the rest of your skin care routine. This suncreen has niacinamide which is a popular active ingredient now so its in a lot of products.The problem is that too much of it is irritating to the skin. So watch out on using more than one product with niacinamide. Same goes other ingredients like hyaluronic acid. Irritation and toxicity is in the dose.I switch between suncreens on days I use other products with niacinamide.," September 25, 2020"

647,GW,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality sunscreen,  Expensive but high quality. Just a little each time goes a long way. Have been using it for years and never had a sunburn again and it doesn't seem as toxic as many cheap brands. My skin is happy.," December 30, 2018"
648,Colin & Adriane Lee-Wo,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm a fan!!!,"  I had been looking for the perfect daily facial sunscreen for a long, long time until I read about this product on a magazine in the waiting room of my doctor's office. I wasn't familiar with the brand, but I read that it was good for oily skin and the fact that it has an awesome rating on the EWG website gave me the final push to go ahead and order it. Now I just can't leave without it! It's part of my everyday routine and it goes well with my anti-aging facial oil. Believe it or not, I am able to get a matte finish by mixing 4 drops of my oil with a dab of this sunscreen and my skin has a beautiful glow and is protected all day long! I would definitely recommend this product!"," April 22, 2013"

654,JL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels like a moisturizer!,"  This is absolutely the best sunscreen for my face! I have sensitive skin and most sunscreens burn my face and eyes,  but this one feels like a moisturizer. I also love that it’s a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t leave me with a greasy white film on my face."," August 29, 2019"
655,Dani21 ,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s okay,"  It ALWAYS ends up peeling. If I wear makeup on top of it an hour or two later my makeup looks like it’s flaking off cause the sunscreen is peeling under it. It blends it nicely and when you least expect it, it begins to peel."," May 13, 2021"
656,Aloha Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,It Doesn't Take Up Any Room In My Bag!!,  I have rosacea so i react to many make up products.  This foundation does not irritate my rosacea.  It's very lightweight.

Seriously no pasty ...""what do you have on your face?"" stuff.  I have melasma on my fore head and it gets worse (a whole lot worse) in sun so I'm careful....all sunscreen are NOT created equal.  This helps protect my brown spots from getting worse and other little spots from starting up.  Yes you have to reapply...but you have to with all of them.  UGH!"," May 17, 2017"

661,monah,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not recommended for darker skin,  I really wanted to love this sunscreen but I couldn't. It made me look washed out kind of gray. I tried to put on a serum beforehand but it still wouldn't blend.  But it didn't make me greasy like other sunscreens. It actually helped with shine and and didn't make me break out.  I tried it for a short time under a bb cream but I don't like the extra step so I gave up. And I have no desire to try and figure out make-up. I'm sure it would work on lighter skin. I gave mine to my super pale boyfriend. The color problem was my only issue.," July 4, 2014"

But this is it, plus it even has some other benefits that I'm sure I've forgotten about but the point is, you need sunscreen, you need to wear it, you want your skin to remain great-looking, and you don't want it to clog your pores. I totally recommend this product! It's easy to apply, a little goes a long way, it's not greasy nor is it pasty, goes on clear and it's so lightweight, it's just perfect."," June 12, 2013"

669,Nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sunscreen!,"  I read an article in a magazine that was written by a female dermatologist and she mentioned that she personally used this sunscreen, so I figured it was a good enough endorsement for me.I found it on Amazon right away and decided to purchase it and I'm really happy that I did.Its light, non-greasy and goes on smoothly.  I put it on over my daily moisturizer before I apply my foundation.  It doesn't ""sit"" on your skin, but rather it rubs in nicely and quickly.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and will continue to use this on a daily basis."," April 4, 2013"
670,GENIE FRISBEE-HIGBEE,5.0 out of 5 stars,great consistency,"  I use this for everyday moisturizer and sunscreen.

672,Girly Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,I hope they never stop making this!,"  This is the only SPF I can use. It's completely non-greasy, non-smelly, doesn't break me out and is just the slightest bit moisturizing so it's perfect under makeup. I have been using this daily for 3 years. I have had some problems with the packaging where the pump was not working straight out of the box. This was frustrating because the bottle doesn't open so there's no way to get the product out. I finally figured out that if you hold the bottle upright and give the bottom of it a good whack on the countertop, it works perfectly after. Must be some air in it that disables the pump. Also, I've noticed some reviews saying that it failed SPF consumer testing. All I know is that I spent all summer at the pool and this is the only thing I used on my face and I never got even a tiny bit bronzed. It seems to work great for sun protection."," October 4, 2015"
673,J. Hiraga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Goes on clear and doesn't feel heavy,"  I love love love this product.  I've been using it for quite some time and have recommended and bought it for my family.  It goes on clear and doesn't feel heavy.  Goes on better than some facial lotion.  Definitely not oily and gives you the protection you need.  I use my normal facial lotion.  Wait until it's completely dry.  Then i apply Eltamed UV clear, wait for that to dry before applying on my makeup or BB cream.  Doesn't make my makeup smear or any other mess.  My make up goes on great.  I love this!  The 1.7 oz may seem small but it lasts me awhile.  I love the ease of the pump."," June 1, 2014"

I love it so much that I sent a bottle to my mother in law.  This makes daily sun protection easy.  Only thing is that I wish it was cheaper.

678,JILL C POWELL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen,  This product goes on smoothly and does not ever look white on my skin.  Feels great and a good moisturizer.  I have the clear and tinted.  It is not greasy or shiny.  Worth the expense!," February 6, 2022"
679,VALadyLaw,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,  I have rosacea.  I have searched for years for a sunblock that will save my face.  This is the first product that did not irate my skin.

681,Anne-Fleur,5.0 out of 5 stars,All-time favourite sunblock,"  I’ve gone through quite a few brands of sunblock and so happy I found this brand through dermatologist recommendations. It is the only one from the countless I’ve tried that does not make me break out. Consistency is light, doesn’t leave a white blanket on your face.

682,Marcia An,1.0 out of 5 stars,Damaged product boxes,"  Packaging was fine but when I received this product, the product box was not in great shape. Along with this product another sunscreen came in a damaged product box along with another product that had a “tester” sticker on the product box.

Tried Neutrogena Clear Face 30 spf and haven't had one single breakout. Usually ""you get what you pay for"" holds true but not in this case! The much cheaper Neutrogena works waaaay better for me."," October 1, 2018"

Great texture under makeup, protects my skin, and does not aggravate my acne-prone skin.However, the most recent one I opened is defective! The dispenser does not work! I got zero use of this product.I purchased a few of these sunblocks off Amazon, so by the time I got to the most recent purchase and opened the package, it was too late to return. Total waste of money! I will not repurchase. I've bought all kinds of items off Amazon for years and have never been disappointed, so I was quite surprised to open a useless product."," March 31, 2016"

690,Lily J,5.0 out of 5 stars,UVA/UVB Protectant- Important!,"  My dermatologist recommend that I use Elta MD bc its formula and it protects 2 ultraviolet radiation UVA/UVB which is important to have in any sunscreen you purchase. Both UVA and UVB rays can increase your risks for skin cancer; additionally, these rays can cause significant sun damage, which leads to wrinkles, hyper pigmentation, and other advanced signs of aging.

It rated moderate for health concerns and poor for UVA/UVB coverage.  I love this sunscreen because it goes on clear and light and helps prevent acne breakouts.  I've been using it a few years after my Dermatologist recommended it.  When I see her again I will be asking her thoughts on this sunscreen.  Anyone else have thoughts on this new EWG ranking?," July 7, 2016"
694,Tori,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, poor bottle design","  I really like this moisturizer with sunscreen. I've used it for a couple years now. I tend to have oily skin and this stuff is great at not making me oilier!! However, the last time I purchased the product they had changed the style of the pump, which is TERRIBLE. The lotion barely comes out and I can't tell if the bottle is running out way sooner than it should be or if it's just the pump mechanism.PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD PUMP STYLE!!!"," April 29, 2016"
695,JG,3.0 out of 5 stars,okay,  It was recommended by my dermatologist but when I used it I had breakouts. Used it only twice," November 22, 2020"
696,Omar S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for oily skin or those sensitive to scent!,"  This sunscreen goes on clear and does not leave my skin feeling greasy or shiny looking.  The thing I like most about this product is that it does not have the harsh vapors and scents I've experienced in many other sunscreens.  I have sensitive eyes that would get irritated from the fumes of other sunscreens, often resulting in a headache.  I no longer have that problem since switching to this sunscreen.  The product is on the pricier side, so I only use it on my face (a little goes a long way).  For me, it's well worth the cost to avoid the headaches and irritation I've experienced from other products.  Overall a great daily facial sunscreen."," January 23, 2013"
697,Doug,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will Not Cause Breakouts,"  This is so rare for a sunscreen, but it won't cause breakouts.

698,Anne D,5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT,"  I wear sunscreen every day and this product is perfect. Light and pleasant, moisturizing.Drugstore sunscreens (even high end ones) often cause a reaction to my sensitive facial skin — this one did not!

699,Morgan L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my sensitive, acne prone skin",  Favorite!!!! Life changing. Rubs in so easily. Doesn’t leave any white behind. Super light weight. No weird smell. Just feels like I’m putting on a light moisturizer. Worth every penny," July 31, 2020"

706,Cheryl D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wowza! I'm in love!,"  I love this stuff!  It is more expensive than its competitors, but it's so light that I can use it EVERY DAY. It's part of my daily routine - even under my make-up. This product is free of the avo-benzone (and the other common ""avo-"" ingredient in sunblocks) - which I have discovered cause me to break-out and turn red. This product is mild - and has never caused my face to inflame or sting, and it works. Can't recall getting sunburned since starting to use it.  It's worth every penny."," June 25, 2016"
707,M R Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plays nice with my rosacea,"  I have rosacea, and most sunscreens aggravate it. Sun exposure does, too. This sunscreen is great for me.

709,Mama Bird,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gross on my skin and burns my eyes,"  I havent used this in major sun but it does seem to work in that regard.  It feels really gross on ny skin and leves a nasty film.  Also, on several occasions Ive rubbed my face hours later and accidentally gotten it in my eyes and it burns like mad.  For this price I say its a hard pass."," October 23, 2019"
710,Connie B. Wolfe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen on the market,"  I have purchased and thrown out more facial sunscreens than I want to admit.  My dermatologist gave me a sample of this sunscreen and I love it.  It is not greasy, goes on light and it does NOT make my face sweat like so many of them do.  This is the perfect sunscreen for your face."," August 19, 2019"

713,livieland,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never using anything else ever!,"  I commute to work, 1.5 hours each way. The sun is on the driver's side when I head to work (rising), and is on the driver's side as I head home (setting). Because of this, I have worn Neutrogena's 50 SPF sunscreen for sensitive skin every day for years. Each summer, once the humidity would set in, I would get acne, especially on my forehead. I finally made the switch to Elta Clear 9 months ago and it has made an enormous difference! My skin is clear, and even though the temperature and humidity are soaring, I haven't seen a hint of even any irritation. It goes on smoothly, and doesn't ever feel heavy or oily. I can't say enough good things about it. It is light, layers under makeup, and my skin has never looked so good!And it is worth every penny. As far as I am concerned, I'm happy to pony up the $30-something cost if it means I can look great, with no hint of a blemish."," June 25, 2014"
714,RS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best SPF for acne prone skin,"  I love this! I have adult acne and almost all SPF I have tried on is either too oily or it worsens my acne. When I found the raving review of this product, I was in doubt. But this SPF does not disappoint. Now my skin looks so much better than before. And my acne condition is surely improving. Highly recommend this product to anyone suffering adult acne like myself."," July 10, 2018"
715,User_7221,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, elegant sunsreen","  This is a really nice sunscreen.  Cosmetically elegant and perfect for every day wear.  It's not ideal for sweating or sports, so I would use a different sunscreen for those purposes (the MDSolarSciences gel sunscreen is my absolute favorite for sweaty activities because it STAYS PUT).  The UV Clear goes on a little shiny at first but I find it mattifies in a few hours.  I usually wear homemade vitamin C serum and CeraVe lotion underneath, or bare if I'm in a hurry.  My skin reacts very positively to niacinamide, which attracted me to this product.  I have normal-dry, acne-prone skin.  This sunscreen does not leave a white cast."," January 20, 2016"
716,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not just zinc!,  Not just zinc oxide!  Be warned. This also contains the sunscreen octinoxate which I am allergic to.

717,Elle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!!!,"  I adore this sunscreen. Perfect! No bad smell, applies easily, you can wear it under makeup. I've bought it many times over! It's especially good if you have sensitive skin and don't like the smell of regular sunscreens, since this is mineral-based. It's also not sticky. Not waterproof though, but that's fine. I wear waterproof when swimming."," December 19, 2018"
718,Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen for brown skin!!,"  This is hands down the best sunscreen. I have dry, acne prone and sensitive skin.

This is a game changer, I’m in love!!"," June 15, 2020"
719,C. Melton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best and easiest 40+ SPF I've every tried, and no more ghost face!","  I've tried a few high SPF products, most recently was Shishedo, and I generally find they are like a thicker lotion consistency and once applied I look like Casper The Ghost, and have to work rigorously to spread evenly.  But not with this stuff - - Etla MD goes on really easy, smooth, and it blends into your skin very quickly, and a little dab goes a long way.  I love the compact size and pump-action which makes it easy to apply as opposed to having to squeeze a bottle (like toothpaste).  Excellent product and I will buy again."," September 6, 2016"
720,Kylene LaBissoniere,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not so much!,"  This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician, whom I trust completely. I tried it and I immediately broke out. Ugh. Not that it’s uncommon for my skin to break out after trying anything different, but this breakout was BAD. And my whole face turned very red and irritated and my skin ached, on top of the breakout. It was horrible. I used it for 2 days (once per day) and I broke out and was irritated for a week! Definitely would not recommend this stuff for sensitive skin. My 2 bottles both appear “legit.” Have no clue how well the sunscreen part works."," July 10, 2020"
721,Gina,4.0 out of 5 stars,One of the better ones,"  The Elta MD sunscreen lines are one of the few that doesn't irritate my skin. Unfortunately, it does make it break out on and off. Not anything terrible, but enough to warrant it as just a back-up if I don't have the Vanicream Sunscreen at hand (which I've grown to love more and is equal to this brand, in my opinion)."," February 20, 2019"
722,Julianne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing! best daily face spf moisturizer,"  Absolutely love this product! everyone should give it a try.  I originally got it from my dermatologist.  It is great for sensitive skin (I have rosacea and am sensitive to fragrance/certain chemicals), but also great for normal skin.  It is spf 46, but does not feel like sunscreen at all. It feels like a light moisturizer, absorbs quickly, no greasiness.  Most daily lotions with spf are only 15, so 46 is great! I use it every single morning.  Because it is a light moisturizer, I will usually apply a thicker moisturizer underneath if my skin is dry.  It sounds pricey for a small bottle, but you only need a little and one bottle will last a long time"," February 4, 2016"
723,Brenda,2.0 out of 5 stars,The chemical smell gives me a headache.,"  I like how nice it makes my skin look, but the chemical smell gives me a headache. Please remove the chemical smell; I will be a forever customer if you do."," March 19, 2021"
724,barbdwyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very moisturizing for 50+ skin,"  Very moisturizing. I find it better in the winter for my 50+ skin. I also like it for my neck area which needs more moisture than my face. A bit expensive, but a little goes a long way & it's better than skin cancer or having skin damage &v wrinkles from the sun."," October 28, 2019"
725,Carolyn Richardson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must buy product!!,"  OH MY GOD THIS PRODUCT IS MY HOLY GRAIL. I’m very sensitive to sunscreens on my face, this is non irritating for sensitive skin.

726,dawntreader,5.0 out of 5 stars,dermatologist recommended this product for use with my rosacea,"  Last summer I was diagnosed with rosacea. Redess, blemishes, you name it. I was miserable. I love the outdoors, but go me! Sun aggravates my rosacea. So does every sunscreen product and moisturizer with sunscreen in it. I was desperate and willing to try anything including a $20+ bottle of sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist, though I was skeptical this would actually help me considering the graveyard of half-used product that did nothing for me but make the redness and blemishes worse.Now, I use Elta 46 SPF Clear DAILY. I never leave the house without applying. It goes on smooth and I let it dry before applying my makeup. It did not cause any additional breakouts. I was outside most weekends this summer and with the exception of a few occasional spots on my nose, the rosacea stayed at bay all summer. I didn't even sunburn. I am THRILLED.Don't use too much or you can't rub it all in--you will feel greasy and it will leave white streaks on your face. I use one squirt for my face and throat and an additional half squirt if I need to cover my neck. (For the rest of my I can use regular sunscreen.) One bottle lasts a good 2-3 months. LOVE IT."," October 25, 2012"
727,Ally,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent.,"  LOVE this. It is actually clear without a white cast, non-scented, and doesn't make me break out. It's not sticky and feels light.Just be warned that it is not compatible with all moisturizers! When using with CeraVe, I would find the product peeling/balling off my face. This happened no matter which I applied first or how well the first product absorbed into my skin before applying the second product. I would recommend using this in combination with an EltaMD moisturizer that is specifically labeled as compatible with EltaMD suncreens."," March 24, 2014"
728,Brooke Harvey,5.0 out of 5 stars,The only moisturizer I will use on my sensitive breakout prone skin,"  If you have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts of any kind, you NEED this moisturizer that doubles as your daily UV. It calms the redness on my skin and actually clears and prevents me from breaking out. It's not heavy at all either. This stuff is a lifesaver I use year round."," November 4, 2019"

730,Nightshade,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relief For My Eyes,"  I've tried other facial sunblocks only to be disappointed.  My eyes were stinging and irritated at times for hours.  I'm not even sure whether they did the job of blocking the UVA or UVB rays either.  But this product really works without the stinging, burning and irritation, and with an added bonus:  It's NOT STICKY or GREASY!  In addition, its a facial moisturizer.  I do suggest that if you're a sweater, you reapply the product every 2 hours or so to be safe from any sun damage."," July 24, 2016"
731,CatBuzzard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great stuff. I'll never age.,"  I burn. It's kinda my thing. I also take a medication that messes with my skin and makes it more likely that a) I'll burn, b) my skin won't heal right, and c) my already sensitive skin is now actively looking for the opportunity to get contact dermatitis. This stays on, permits no sun through, and doesn't give me a rash. It also doen't smell, which is another thing I appreciate."," May 1, 2018"
732,NoName,3.0 out of 5 stars,No moisture,"  This went on creamy and clear, then became sticky and eventually dried, sucking out the moisture from my face. I bought this to use under my make up.

736,TheOnlineAddict,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Sensitive Skin - Helps Keep Acne Redness Down from Sun Exposure,"  First recommended by my son's dermatologist, we were hesitant at first because he has *very* sensitive skin, so nearly any cream or sunscreen based product has caused him to break out in the past. This one, on the other hand, is the exception and he absolutely loves it. For those with teenagers who have acne, use this sunscreen. Not only does it help keep the redness down from any scarring or active bumps when in the sun, it also lightens up the face a little bit, causing it to look very clear."," June 21, 2016"
737,AMY M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent light weight sunscreen!,  I have acne prone skin and suffer from hyperpigmentation.  This wears beautifully under makeup.  Does not leave a white cast.

It has not caused any breakouts and was everything I was looking for in a sunscreen.," June 14, 2017"
738,Pedro Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not have a white cast,"  This is good on sensitive skin and does not have a white cast. I would recommend this, its rare to find something that works for sensitive skin and no fragrance."," December 24, 2020"
739,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,  I have sensitive skin and when I put on. Standard sunscreen on my face there is an immediate burning sensation. I’ve tried everything marked sensitive including baby sunscreen. I had started not using anything as sunburn was easier to deal with and less painful. This was recommended by my dermatologist and I was hesitant given the price; but this is worth it! No burning! It lasts a long time and doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy. I use it daily and love it!," June 24, 2018"
740,Kim S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,EltaMD UV CLEAR is a great Broad Spectrum SPF for sensitive skin,"  EltaMD UV CLEAR is a great Broad Spectrum SPF for sensitive skin.  Doesn't irritate my skin like a lot of sunscreens and sunblock products.  Very effective at preventing sun damage, redness and melasma.  ***I also use the EltaMD tinted version which is fabulous at evening out skin tone.  I use the tinted product in place of base makeup and LOVE IT!!!  Will definitely be purchasing MORE."," June 7, 2017"
741,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smooth and light like a premium skincare,"  I read about this on a dermatologist’s (@lauralacquer) blog and I’m so happy I bought it! It’s a mineral sunscreen, which is better for you than chemical sunscreen. It goes on thin, smooth and feels quality, like a skincare product you’d get from Sephora...it doesn’t feel sunscreen-y at all! And of course, it did the job! No burns from my 4 day beach vacation!"," June 22, 2019"
742,Coast2Coast,2.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid if you are sensitive to “chemical” scents,"  Works as a hypoallergenic sunscreen for sensitive skin, but the low rating is due to the chemical smell that persists until it is washed off.  This is fragrance-free, but is is not scent-free (likely due to the innate scents of the ingredients used in the sunscreen).  If you are sensitive to such smells, avoid."," June 13, 2019"
743,VZ112311,3.0 out of 5 stars,Contains Octinoxate,"  While this might be a wonderful sunscreen, I was looking for something chemical-free.  This product contains 7.5% octinoxate.  I found no mention of this in the product description."," April 1, 2021"
744,careful buyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,good sunscreen,  I bought this for my husband who is out in the sun daily. He normally does not like to wear sunscreen due to it getting in his eyes and such. He said that this sunscreen was good and was not too greasy.," June 11, 2021"
745,Rose r,1.0 out of 5 stars,leaving white caste,  I am getting acne even after using this. But not as frequently compared to other products in the market. It does white caste after using it. Not a huge fan of it.," December 14, 2020"
746,KathyP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lasts a long time!,"  I know it's pricey but using this once per day, I can get 6 months of use out of this bottle. It doesn't cause me to breakout, it absorbs fast, and I can apply most liquid foundation on top of it and it won't cause issues. My dermatologist recommended this brand because it blocks uva and uvb Rays."," April 25, 2019"
747,T.B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for sensitive and acne-prone skin!,"  I have terribly sensitive skin that reacts poorly to any products with color or fragrance. It is also very prone to acne. When I use products that are meant to fight acne, my skin will dry out and then produce too much oil to compensate, causing pimples to form anyway. This product does not irritate or dry out my skin whatsoever. It does not leave oily residue at all; instead, it makes my skin feel soft and clean. It offers great sun protection- my skin is also extremely sensitive to the sun, and my face is often red all summer from sun damage. This product has helped immensely to give me sun protection without causing a breakout or making my skin feel gross. I am ecstatic that I have found something that works after having tried dozens of other products! Highly recommended, it actually holds up to the claims that it makes."," May 23, 2016"
748,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great but pricey,"  I loved this face sunscreen. This used to be about 20 dollars but they increased the price. The only reason I stopped buying this is because I finish it way too fast due to how much the pump dispenses and the price keeps creeping up. I replaced this with the new shiseido sunscreen for face and body since it’s also goes on clear, it last longer , and has a higher spf."," December 20, 2018"
749,Randy Richards,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"  I have been using this lotion for a couple of years now. It is the perfect first layer to your makeup routine.

752,J. Rodgers,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed:  Very Small Amount of Actual Sunscreen in the Container,"  I guess the sunscreen is ok, but it ran out very quickly.  I don't think I got 10 applications of this sunscreen before it was empty.  Normally can get about 50 applications from most sunscreen bottles."," July 3, 2021"
753,WhoAmI?,3.0 out of 5 stars,The rating it deserves depends on your expectations,"  I noticed that a lot of these reviews are written only after the first few uses of the product so I wanted to have more use out of it before giving my opinion.  Before I get into reviewing I will mention what type of skin I have to give others an idea of what they might expect.Acne has never been a serious problem for me like for some family members of mine.  I rarely have more than 4 zits on my face at a time, but I probably spend about 4 months out of the year with zits on my face. I get ugly brown freckles from the sun (and not the cute kind) so I try to wear sunscreen, but it doesn't seem to matter what type I try and I've tried a LOT- whether they are non-clogging or oil-free or super light or sprays or sticks or lotions or soaps (yes I've even tried the sunscreen soaps) they all seem to make any existing acne on my face worse.  IF I keep a healthy skin regimen I can usually use these sunscreens without them causing acne.. but once I already have it- pfft.  Forget it.  ANYTHING you put over those blemishes aside from acne medication or water makes it worse.  I usually have to wait for the blemishes to dissappear completely before I can start using sunscreen on those areas again, or else they will never dissappear.What I'd really like is a Sunscreen that doesn't just claim to not cause acne but actually CLEARS acne.  Only because in my experience- products that just claim to not cause acne... end up causing it anyway or at least making the ones you already have worse.  Products that aim to TREAT acne (such as certain makeup products that clear up acne while providing coverage) either clear it up or simply prevents it from getting worse.  Such a sunscreen is difficult if not impossible to find.  Probably because the acids used to clear up acne would only eat through any sunscreen product anyway.But when I ordered this I was hoping that maybe they finally got around that problem.  Because I ordered this with the hope that it would either help clear existing acne OR KEEP IT FROM GETTING WORSE.  I personally have not found this to be the case.  It IS the lightest sunscreen I have ever experienced.  5 minutes after putting it on you feel like you just washed your face with water only- It really is THAT good.  So light it actually makes you feel you have nothing on and makes you wonder whether there's any actual protection from the sun at all.  When I first started using this I was so surprised how good and light it felt that I became very excited thinking I have finally found 'the one'!  But now that I've been using it for a few weeks it's become apparent that using this product daily over existing acne gives me the same problem that other products do.  Just makes the acne that's already there worse.  Perhaps not as bad as my other sunscreens- but still worse than with no sunscreen at all.In conclusion-  I think this is a great product if you have oily skin and are prone to acne because I do not think it will CAUSE acne to appear.  However if you already have acne on your face and are hoping this is a sunscreen you can use over your already-acne'd skin without making what's already there worse (ie larger or cystic) , you will probably be dissappointed.  So just like my other 'skin-clearing' sunscreens, I have to shelve this product whenever I have an outbreak."," July 10, 2013"
754,Blunny Fan,4.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect sunscreen but too pricey with eco unfriendly packaging,"  Really nice sunscreen -light texture, non oily and unscented.

But doesn't last long under makeup either. Going back to my mineral based sunscreen.," June 25, 2016"
762,Ricky Davila,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for SPF, but not moisturizing","  This is a great SPF if you're just looking for a basic SPF. It provides great coverage/protection, and lasts most of the day. However, I was a bit disappointed to find out that it does not give you much in the way of moisture. I guess I've gotten used to facial sunscreens that give you a big moisture boost, but I was expecting a bit more out of an expensive product like this. Now, you can put moisture on separately, but that's time I'd like to spend doing something else. I did see that they have a version that provides more moisture so once I finish using this up I'll probably give that one a shot."," December 31, 2015"
763,M. St. Clair,4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall good product,"  I recently switched over to the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 from the UV Daily because of the hot, humid weather in NYC.PROS: Easy to apply, lightweight: the UV Clear is less moisturizing than the UV Daily which is a plus if you tend to sweat a lot in the face. No allergic reactions so far, and I do have hyperpigmentation and photosensitive skin if you're curious to know.CONS: Other customers have complained about the UV Clear flaking off. Yes, the sunscreen does rubbed off  if you layered foundation on top. You may want to experiment some more and make it work for you. Most days, I go about bare face except for lip balm and a floppy hat."," June 29, 2015"
764,officialSB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not clear, Not for AA skin.",  By “clear” I thought the sunscreen would be for all skin colors.

765,AmazonFiend,5.0 out of 5 stars,A decade of fandom for this product,"  I’ve yet to find a better face sunscreen.

This is the best for sensitive skin."," June 6, 2019"
766,S. S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Pump doesn't work, very disappointed","  I am very disappointed. I have purchased this product before (not sure if the same seller) and had no issues. This one, the pump is broken, it does not work at all. I didn't open the new product until the other had run out, and now it is too late to return. It is next to impossible to open and close this container to use it without the pump, so I basically can't use it. Not to mention that that is unsanitary, which is why I choose products that can be dispensed as opposed to dipping fingers/hands into it. I will definitely not purchase from this seller again as I now have no form of recourse and a fairly expensive skin product I cannot use."," September 18, 2015"

It is gentle and doesn't cause stinging. I use it every day. If you're combing it with other products, let the others absorb well before applying this sunscreen. If you don't, the product may bead up causing little white balls to form. It doesn't do that when I don't use other products underneath it or let them absorb first. Makeup over it works fine. I'm acne prone so this product is known for being good on skin types prone to breakouts. It doesn't clog pores and is non-greasy."," December 14, 2014"

783,Well-traveled,3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sunscreen,"  I buy a slightly higher SPF at me doctor's and it really works better.  I am not getting enough protection with the ones I justpurchased on Amazon.  Very strange because I usually love this product.  I'm going back to buying the very slightly higher SPF from my doctor.  I am wondering why that one is NOT sold on Amazon.  Again, I find that very strange.  I am obsessed with protecting my skin from sun damage and I am very disappointed with this product from Amazon."," March 2, 2016"
784,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunblock for your face and neck,  I've been using this product for years. I have very sensitive skin and can break out from changing shampoo. I play a lot of golf in AZ and have used several of the store brands over the years that either cause me skin issues or do not protect. This stuff just works well. Lasts all day long with the exception of swimming for extended periods. Takes very little to cover my face and neck.," May 12, 2019"
785,Peter DiManno,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen,"  Favorite face sunscreen! Does not leave weird white residue or greasy finish. Absorbs easily into skin, makeup can go over it without issue. I use this this daily! 10/10 would recommend and will be repurchasing"," June 15, 2021"
786,thecatlady,5.0 out of 5 stars,but it does not give me that disgusting oily shine that other suncreen lotions have done in ...,"  The only sunscreen lotion I'll ever put on my face. Not only is the application light, but it does not give me that disgusting oily shine that other suncreen lotions have done in the past. I have very acne prone skin, and this lotion has helped my skin from acting out. I have used this product for nearly 6 months and my overall skin complexion has gotten noticeably better. I only apply this once in the morning and I can feel it working throughout the day. This lotion is a must have in your purse ladies!"," August 22, 2015"
787,Kelsey David,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never using anything else!,"  The best face sunscreen out there! I have sensitive skin that will react and breakout or itchy bumps at a lot of face products...not with this. I’ve probably tried over a dozen face sunscreens and this by far surpasses all of them. Lightweight, super easy to apply, doesn’t leave a chalky white residue, great sun protection all while providing the perfect amount of moisture. This stuff is well worth the price."," June 3, 2019"
788,BirdieGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love it!,"  Not only is sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist, but it is recommended by me!  This is my go to sunscreen when I expect to be out in the sun most of the day, like playing golf, for instance.  I have very fair skin and can burn easily.  I never fear that happening when I'm wearing this sunscreen.  It is not greasy, absorbs quickly, and works wonderfully well under my makeup.  I highly recommend this."," August 22, 2016"
789,JC,1.0 out of 5 stars,Severely allergic to this product,"  Soon after using the product, my face swelled up. It became very itchy and red. Few more days later, my cheeks got scabs on them and my lips started oozing liquid. I had to go see a doctor and found out that I'm highly allergic to this product. I stopped using the product few months ago but my lips have never recovered. I normally don't have allergic reactions to anything. This is the first time in my life I was allergic to something. I wouldn't recommend this sunscreen."," June 10, 2018"
790,Elilinchan,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite!,"  Best sunscreen I've ever used, and trust me I've tried so so many of them. It is so hard to find a product that does not smell like sunscreen. I cannot stand the smell. This particular product barely has scent. It sinks into your skin even though you feel you might have put way too much. My dermatologist tells me that people don't put enough to be effective, but how can you when the product just sits on your face? This product you can put as much as you want and it soaks in. I know I'm really protecting my face! It is a bit expensive for the size of the bottle (1.7oz), but I will be asking too much!"," July 27, 2012"
791,Nymeria Forreste,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s okay, mainly use it on my neck","  i didn’t really enjoy using this product on my face, I’ve really just stuck to using it on my neck. I really wanted this to work on my face because it is a physical sunscreen. But, it was just constantly pilling on my face. At first, I thought it was because I wore moisturizer under. So, I stopped that and just put the sunscreen straight on my skin. That didn’t work either. So, I’ve opted to just using it on my neck and it’s worked great for that. If it pills, I mean, I don’t even notice."," November 7, 2018"
792,April,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen on the market,  This is the BEST sunscreen on the market. It’s lightweight and doesn’t smell. My brother is a burn survivor and his burn surgeon recommends this brand. I wear this under my makeup and moisturizer and it doesn’t make my skin oily. I can even wear by itself. Get this stuff!!," October 5, 2020"
793,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,This is incredibly expensive for less than 2 ounces!,"  I did not do my due diligence and scrutinize the order for the correct ounce size - because honestly I didn't think that anything smaller than 2 oz would cost $32, but you got me on this one! I mean, honestly how do people get away with this? Its ridiculously overpriced in my opinion. Because I wok in Real Estate, I hardly have time to go schlep to the post office to return things so I will keep this  but I honestly am so dissapointed in the product. It's less than half of what I expected. Seriously?"," April 21, 2020"
794,DLAGNDT,4.0 out of 5 stars,best Moisturizer with SPF - NO BREAKOUTs!!!,"  I am in LOVE with this product. A friend recommended this Moisturizer with SPF as the ONLY one on the market that has not made her break-out.  I completely agree! I have super sensitive skin and this gives me a non-sticky surface (let it sink in) and for some reason, I don't need foundation after I apply this even though there is no pigment in it.what an awesome product!"," January 30, 2017"
795,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't leave hoe without it!,  This is my go-to face product now.  I even use on my daughter's face because it is so gentle and long lasting.  The odor is nothing special but I think the quality is great.  spreads on nicely.  I use some loose makeup powder to tame the shine...I use it every day now!," June 25, 2019"
796,Jacky,5.0 out of 5 stars,I live in the desert where sunscreen is NOT optional.... this one is TOPS!,"  This is absolutely the best sunscreen I have used.  It goes on light and non-greasy, and never leaves a white cast on my face.It goes on flawlessly under foundation, too.  What other sunscreen can you say that about?I have skin that is very prone to redness and irritation, but I actually look forward to putting on my Eltamd sunscreen, because it calms and moisturizes my skin. Pop it in the fridge for a nice chilling effect, it feels great on summer days!"," April 17, 2015"

798,Lychelle Lowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Facial sunscreen,  Originally my Dermtologist prescribed it for my skin . It works really well for me so I was happy to find it on amazon so that I didn’t have to go to the dermatologist just to get some more," June 2, 2020"
799,lo zazu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great coverage,"  I buy this for the quality and coverage. My facial lady recommended it, and I like that it’s light weight, not greasy, and doesn’t have much of a scent. I mix it with my non-spf face cream and it mixes well. Absorbs pretty quick and I’m able to wear under my make up with no problems."," April 3, 2020"
800,Liv,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen ever!,"  I recommend this sunscreen to anyone that I hear talking about sunscreen - even if I'm not part of the conversation! I love it that much. It is not greasy nor smells weird. Plus, it feels great on the skin once it's absorbed (takes less than 1 or 2 minutes)."," October 28, 2019"
801,MsMAN,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best for the Super Sensitive,  I have an exceptional sensitivity to chemical sunscreens so I am forced to use only physical sunscreen with one exception (for some reason I can tolerate octixionate -sp-)  There is always a catch-22 with physical sunscreens.  Either they are so opaque you appear to be ghostly or if its not opaque the spf is so low its not worth using. The Eltamd UV Clear is phenomienal.  I put it on under my makeup.  In the summer it even provided enough moisture for my skin so I only needed to use it alone without a moisturizer.  Bottomline I highly recommend it!," October 3, 2013"
802,susieque,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great UV protection. Highly recommend it.,"  This is a great sun protection facial lotion for sensitive/acne prone skin. Foundation goes on well over it too. I used to buy Elta MD at my dermatologist's office then he retired, so I'm glad to find it on Amazon now."," July 5, 2020"
803,PeachyPie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed!,"  Love this product! I managed to fry & dry out my shoulders and chest over a holiday weekend, but my face stayed safe and hydrated with one application of this product in the morning."," July 7, 2020"

805,NJ Teacher  Way to Be,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Product,"  My dermatologist suggested this product for me and my daughter who has acne-prone skin.  The doctor's office sold it for a great deal more money, but I found it on Amazon for a lower price. I use it every day.  It absorbs quickly and it doesn't show.  I like it."," July 7, 2019"
806,Rachel Ann Hamilton,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is far ans away the best sunblock I've ever used,"  Product gets a 5.Packaging gets a 1.This is far ans away the best sunblock I've ever used.  The problem is that more than half of the bottles (7/10)  I've ordered have a DYSFUNCTIONAL PUMPING mechanism.  After a few pumps, the mechanism simply stops working - I push and nothing comes out.The bottle is sealed in a way that I've had to resort to using pliers to pry the bottle open and painstakingly transfer the product into another container.  It's a hassle and a mess and it's not what I expect to see from a product of this quality.I'm surprised not to find more reviews from people who've had this experience because it's happened to me over and over,  with bottles purchased in several orders over the course of a year.  I kept thinking it was just a defective batch of bottle but then it happened again.  Boo!"," May 12, 2015"
807,Catherine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not great for my dry face, but still seems like a solid product","  I feel compelled to give this 4/5 stars even though I can't use the product on my face—it's not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. It doesn't purport to be hyper-moisturizing, so I'm not necessarily complaining, just stating a fact. I'm able to use it on my neck without issue, so that's what I've been doing, and it's worked perfectly well. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone with combination, oily, or acne-prone skin (and I might buy it again for my neck, because it's lightweight, absorbs and spreads easily, and doesn't give me neck zits)."," November 3, 2016"
808,L. Rakovan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful for acne-prone skin,"  This product was recommended by my dermatologist and it's wonderful for acne prone skin. It goes on clear and light and there is no greasy residue. I stopped using this product for a while (switched to the 40 spf version because it was cheaper) and my skin broke out horribly. After starting on this product again after about a year, my skin cleared up and has been great ever since. I put this on my face and neck no matter what the weather or time of year. I am a 44 year-old female."," September 22, 2015"

I was also red after wearing it in the sun. I’ve heard such amazing things about this product, I’m not sure if it’s the sunscreen or 3rd party retailer but I had to return it."," April 28, 2019"
813,Shannon A S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite,"  My favorite sunscreen. Vital part of my am skincare. Doesn’t smell like I’ve opened a bottle of sunscreen either. Love. Can’t say enough, I’ve tried so many facial sunscreens- spreads easily, is moisturizing and smells great."," April 25, 2021"

I've tried most of the products out there and have yet to find a sunscreen that has sufficient SPF, won't cause me to break out if I use it every day like I'm supposed to, and won't make my face shiny.

817,Queen 4ever,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT FOR DARK SKIN :(,"  Leaves a ridiculously heavy white cast considering the fact that they chose to call it “clear facial sunscreen.” Falsely named and advertised. Also pills if layered with other moisturizer, serums, and/or makeup. Money wasted."," February 7, 2021"
818,Dom,1.0 out of 5 stars,RETURNING,"  First, I love Elta MD sunscreen! But as you can see from the photos- it’s not new. Box was a little squished- not a big deal, but when opened the box you can see this product has been used by the product that is inside the cap."," June 30, 2021"
819,MommyS,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love that it comes in a pump so I don't ...,"  I've tried at least a dozen sunscreens for my sensitive skin on my face.  This product is the only one that didn't leaving a stinging sensation after putting it on my face or made my eyes burn if I accidentally rub them.  It's also not greasy at all and rubs in well (no white streaks).  It's water resistant, but I always reapply every half  hour if I'm in the water and every hour or so if I'm just out and about in the sun.  I love that it comes in a pump so I don't have to shake or thump a bottle to get sunscreen out."," July 29, 2015"

821,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Necessity in my Morning Routine,"  I ordered this product after doing some research.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be careful about which products I use. Sunscreen is a must and due to my skin, I have tried  a lot. Most sunscreens I used before were too greasy, too fragrant, too sticky, or they irritated my skin. Some were not moisturizing enough and would dry my skin out. I have even using EltaMD since March and it has worked great!!! It's moisturizing, no greasy at all, and does not have a scent. I use this twice a day and have still not run out of the first bottle. A little goes a long way. I received a legitimate product that and had a great experience. I have ordered a second bottle and have no reason to believe it is fake."," August 14, 2018"

824,Pris W,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sunscreen that clogs pores and causes bad breakouts,"  This sunscreen is advertised clearly that it doesn't clog pores and is for acne prone skin. At first, I thought it was my cleansers or serums that had problem. It clogged the pores severely on my cheek, nose, forehead, and chin, and it made me break out badly. I constantly had to get professional help for my skin. Once I switched to a new mineral sunscreen, my face starts to clear up and no more clogged pores. This sunscreen is not made for acne prone skin at all. It turns your skin to acne prone."," July 9, 2019"
825,bubba,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does not sting at all!,"  I have tried a ton of face sunscreens and they all eventually end up in my eyes and sting a little.

828,Matthew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the price,"  Regarding fake product, I made sure to buy it ""Sold from Amazon.com"" and had no issue.

831,Eric Avila,3.0 out of 5 stars,sadly not as expected,"  a bit disappointed with this, i was expecting it to be a clear sincere as it says but its more like a white lotion that ended up leaving a white cast on my face. while it works great as a sunscreen i don't think they should be calling this ""clear"" if it leaves a white cast and comes out like a white lotion."," September 13, 2018"

She recommended me a new skincare regime, which included this sunscreen. Mind you, literally every sunscreen I've used lent to a breakout after just a couple days' use. I have used this product every day for years now--no breakouts! Worth the pricetag, in my opinion."," August 29, 2016"

837,Carlotita,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it.,"  First day wearing it. Perfect. Not greasy like other sunscreens that lay on top of your face. This stuff absorbs into your skin like a good moisturizer. I don't wear foundation, but I do mix it with my tinted moisturizer/illuminator. It is white coming out of the bottle, but does not stay white once applied. I have a dark complexion like Queen Latifah and there is no white residue at all! Finally. Yes, it is more expensive than what you would find in the drug store, but for me, it is worth it. Something I can wear everyday knowing that I'm not looking like I stuck my face in talcum powder."," October 12, 2015"
838,Liz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super duper! Highest recommendation!,"  Wow. This stuff really is amazing. I am a fair-skinned person who can burn in minutes. I try really hard to wear clothes that cover as much surface area as possible and I wear hats. But, like all of us, I have to wear some spf on my face. This is the first product I have ever tried that doesn't feel or smell weird. And I have gone on walks at various times in the day and the small amount I put on in the morning still keeps me protected. I give it the highest recommendation possible."," May 23, 2015"
839,Jill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for people with rosacea,"  My dermatologist told me to use this because I complained that regular sunscreen causes my rosacea to flare.

844,NYC,5.0 out of 5 stars,The ONLY one I will use from now on!,"  This is the lightest sunblock that I could find so far and at a lower price. My dermatologist said that I should use something with zinc, and this one has it. I used to use their other sunblock, but this one is much lighter. It seems to be designed for people with acne, which I do not have, which is probably the reason it is so light. Does not leave the white paste on your face, and is really clear, as it says. Will buy again absolutely."," July 3, 2016"

I've been using sunscreen as a daily am moisturizer on and off for years now, but there were key things that were preventing me from using it on a regular basis. No matter how many sunscreen brands I turned to, they either made white streaks, my skin more oily/shiny, and broke me out! This has been an absolutely lifesaver, while my skin still gets oily, it doesn't break me out or flake or leave white streaks! Absolute lifesaver."," November 15, 2013"
851,Nicole S Smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dispenser/pump flaw,"  The pump dispenser design is different than past bottles I have bought from this company.  After a month, the dispenser part broke and I can't fix it and I can only get a tiny bit of lotion out.  The return window closed and I have most of the lotion left and I can't get it out of the bottle.  The new bottle design is terrible.  I also contacted the company and they told me that I can only contact amazon to fix it and that they are not ""affiliated with amazon and therefore can't help me.""  I found this to be very disappointing as this is a design flaw.  The lotion works very well, so I will purchase again, but if the pump design is the same (more rounded and short) I will return it right away."," March 23, 2016"

854,Heather Folsom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yay physical sunscreen without looking like a ghost!,"  Great stuff - have been using this regularly for awhile as my daily facial sunscreen.  I've been looking for this kind of product for awhile, as I do need sunscreen being so pale, but also having acne and having most products giving me breakouts.  The bottle is well made and I have a lot of control of how much sunscreen comes out (I only need a little bit).  Goes on smooth and no problems with having a white residue, which may be a first.  If you are looking for a great quality physical sunscreen, this works fabulously!"," September 9, 2013"
855,K. Sky,5.0 out of 5 stars,favorite zinc based sunscreen,  I got away from using avobenzene products and this is an excellent alternative. I wear it daily either alone or under makeup. no breakouts or gross smells.," November 25, 2020"
856,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have super sensitive/intolerant skin and this doesn't break it out at ...,"  I have super sensitive/intolerant skin and this doesn't break it out at all (break out as in allergy irritation and also no extra acne either) It advertises niacin to help with redness/what ever else niacin is supposed to help with but I don't notice a difference. When I am out directly in the sun for at least a continuous 5-10 minutes my skin starts to burn and will continue to burn/hurt/throb for like 5 hours afterward, this hasn't stopped that so I am not sure if it is blocking the UVA/UVB rays!"," November 5, 2016"

860,Rob,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best,"  I've reached the point in life where my skin has become ""sensitive"".  For me, regular sunscreen not only was greasy and uncomfortable - but it usually made my skin very red and irritated.  After a lot of trial and error, I found Elta MD products.  While this stuff seems pricey, it's really great.  My skin doesn't react negatively to the product at all.  It's does a great job in protecting my skin from getting burned.  It's very light, and I hardly know it's there.  No greasy feel at all.  Great product.  The only sunscreen I use."," August 31, 2013"
861,Kenya_Supreme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, Love, Love!",  I so love this product. I have been searching for a sunscreen that works under makeup for a really long time now. I had acne prone skin and I have combination skin. Most of the sunscreens I tried were very oily. This caused my skin to break out even more. When I saw the reviews of this product by women who have the same problems with their skin I had to try it. The price of this product is kinda steep but I think it's truly worth it because my skin is beginning to heal. I will definitely be buying this product again.," August 17, 2013"
862,Maria Palazzo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This actually caused breakouts on me, beware!","  Okay, so my skin reacted really poorly to this. Be careful if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin. I actually really liked this at first, it felt smooth on and didn't make my skin look greasy. However, almost immediately I started getting cystic acne in places I don't even normally get pimples (my cheeks and under my freaking eyebrow, for one). This stuff is supposed to be for people it's acne-prone skin, so I didn't think that was the cause at first. I caved and stopped using it and my skin stopped breaking out. Bleh. What a waste of money."," December 7, 2017"
863,DogsRFamily,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of $$$$,"  I have sensitive skin. I wanted to try this again after samples from my dr’s office, but NOPE! I had horrible hives for 3 days after using. Same happened from the samples (not as bad but that was first use). Allergic reactions tend to worsen with time."," June 5, 2019"
864,Gwendolyn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen ever!,"  My husband is a farmer and has had melanoma twice so sunscreen is a must. We've tried everything on the market but he's has issues with redness,stinging and discomfort on his face after a 16 hr day in the fields. Not with this product!! He will never use another type of sunscreen after this. It goes on easily, invisible and non sticky. There is no skin irritation after working and wearing a cap/ hat all day. No strong odor either."," June 21, 2016"
865,DLA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Top Notch for Acne Prone Skin,"  I am in my early 30s with very oily, acne prone skin.  I didn't think that SPF protection and acne prone skin could live in harmony until my doctor put me on a skin regimen that included this product.  I have been a faithful user of this stuff for 2 years and nary a breakout.  I think it has helped fade older hyperpigmentation too. One minor issue is that I tend to look shiny after an application but I don't mind since I wear foundation and powder most days. As long as they make this I am buying it."," January 8, 2014"
866,Hannah Huskey,5.0 out of 5 stars,If every sunscreen breaks you out- get this one.,"  I have SUPER sensitive skin. My skin is especially resistant to sunscreen. I've tried a ton of acne-prone safe sunscreens and this is the only one that works for me. If you're prone to malassezia folliculitis/fungal acne, this is the sunscreen for you. It doesn't leave a white film and it's very light. It also has niacinamide, which is a skincare superstar that everybody needs in their routine. Especially in the winter! Get this sunscreen for the love of god."," December 6, 2018"
867,ReviewedByMama,2.0 out of 5 stars,Greasy and caused breakout,"  I have well-controlled adult acne and I began feeling the pre-breakout inflammation within the first hour of wearing.

868,Fgr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Sensitive skin,"  It does not irritate my sensitive skin nor affect my makeup. It seems to work well for different skin types (me, sibling, mother). I layer on top of my moisturizer during cold weather and wear it alone in the summer. Worth the price."," April 23, 2021"
869,Betty Banos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended by my doctor,"  I have combination skin and although I do not go out in the sun, I live in South Florida. I am 39 and have been blessed with pretty good skin although I do breakout on the chin at times usually due to stress and/or hormones. And I have two dark spots. So I bought this product first from a doctor to use as a daily part of my regime before leaving the house and still do. Does not cause breakouts, is not greasy, and is easy to put on under your make-up before you go out. Do it, protect the health of your skin."," April 19, 2013"
870,elaine,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for sensitive, irritable skin","  Everything irritates my skin. Water irritates my skin. This does not. It goes on like a moisturizer and leaves no white cast behind like most mineral sunblocks. It has an odd smell but I've come to kind of like it because I associate it with the cool, calming feeling of putting it on. I wear it everyday and I don't plan to change to another brand--this is it for me."," December 8, 2020"
871,Taylor,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pulling/flaking,"  This product pills on me no matter what I do. Even when it’s not layered with anything else, it just flakes and looks terrible.

872,bet,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect sunscreen,  I love this facial sunscreen. It glides on like silk and drys quickly. There is no greasey shine or whiteness. Drys clear as the name says.

873,Michael Fink,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT FOR MEN!,"  My esthetician friend suggested this for me because I didn't like all the other ones that felt oily or left me shining.This works really well, doesn't smell like anything, and has gotten me to wear it more regularly.I still put a moisturizer on under it, so I don't know how well it works as a moisturizer, but I'd recommend it to anyone."," May 25, 2019"
874,Chris Van Loan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Non greasy- excellent,"  Once I started using this, other blocks seem too thick and greasy for my face. Also works great to moisturize and builds up less over the day than other blocks I’ve tried. This is all I use now on my fave despite going through a tube or two a month."," October 13, 2019"

876,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for oily skin - doesn't sting eyes,"  I had a skin cancer removed from my nose, and was instructed to use a zinc oxide sun screen. I have oily skin. I have had problems in the past with sunscreens stinging my eyes (even the daily moisturizer with SPF). I LOVE this product! I use it every morning. It is a bit shiny when applied. Other than that, I don't notice it. It doesn't take much (it has a pump and I don't depress the pump all the way). I asked the doctor if I needed to be using more; he said more often, not more quantity."," September 15, 2014"
877,Glimmer88,3.0 out of 5 stars,I don’t get the love for this sunscreen……,  It pills up no matter what skincare I wear underneath.  I’m not foregoing my skincare underneath my makeup so I’m returning and will wear my other sunscreens that DONT PILL.," March 9, 2022"

879,Critical Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,  I have been using it for a few days now. So far it is great! It is oil free and I have seen so much difference in my skin. I have very oily skin. Most sunblock reinforces the prodcution of oil which of course will later cause breakouts due to the accumulation of more dirt. I really am very picky with skin creams. This is more costly compared to any other sunblock purchased at stores but it is a quality product. The only problem is that the bottle is small and I am sure to finish the bottle quickly. I will order again before I consume it. This is great really. I  love it so far...," December 4, 2013"

881,Ria,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best for Acne-prone skin,"  This is the best sunscreen for acne-prone skin! I really noticed an improvement while using this as well. My skin looks smoother and more clear. I still had to add just a dab of my moisturizer to this, especially since I use a high percent retin-a micro. I wish there was a clear window to view how much product is left. I seemed to use the product pretty quickly. I am a black woman with deep complexion and the usual sunscreen cast was not bad for me."," June 20, 2016"
882,Britney,5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite sunscreen everrr!! <33,"  Absolutely loooved this product, so great for acne prone skin or sensitive skin. Doesn’t leave a white residue when rubbed in correctly. Never going back to another facial sunscreen, can’t live without this!"," June 10, 2020"

884,BC Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for acne-prone skin!,"  I absolutely love this sunscreen. It has a high SPF, and it goes on light and rubs in very easily. I have oily skin that's prone to breakouts, and this sunscreen actually helped my acne. I didn't notice this until I ran out, but when I stopped using it I started getting acne around my jawline. It's completely scent-free, so if you're sensitive or allergic this would be ideal. I use it daily in the summer, and for outdoor winter activities like skiing. I will definitely buy this again!"," December 23, 2012"
885,Skyler F,1.0 out of 5 stars,Gave me a terrible reaction even after patch testing,"  I'm not sure if I recieved a fake product, or I was just allergic. I tested on my wrist, everything seemed okay 24 hrs later. So, I used the product on my face. The next day my eyes were swollen shut and my face and neck are red and swollen. I would attach a picture but its embarrassing lol. I was so excited to use this, it went on smooth and no white cast. I wont ever be using it again unfortunately."," March 24, 2021"

889,Roses in Grayslake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, effective sunblock for oily skin.","  After searching for years, I have finally landed on this excellent sunblock for oily skin. Highly protective, I use it on my face and apply a dusting of powder. The finish stays for hours and it has a very high level of both a clear zinc oxide and niacinamide, an ingredient of great benefit for the skin. Most sunblocks with (is it 9%?) zinc oxide look awful on my somewhat darker skin. This is my second order of this product, and I plan to keep it in stock."," August 26, 2015"

The SPF is just a bonus.,"  I don't even view this as an SPF lotion, this is the best daytime moisturizer that I've ever used.  I have acne-prone, sensitive, fair, combination skin, and this has transformed my skin.  It evened out my complexion, it continually evens my skin-tone, it's like wearing nothing at all, it is weightless.  My normally oily/combination skin becomes calm, perfect, non-oily, non-dry, beautiful skin.  To me it's just a bonus that this has SPF at all, its just the best moisturizer I've ever used.  I used everything from Laura Mercier, Murad, DDF, Lancome, Nuetrogena, and so on and so forth.  This is the best."," May 6, 2016"

898,Ash795,5.0 out of 5 stars,No white cast!,  This sunblock is on the pricey side but I'm really happy with it.

This hasn't caused any breakouts, and I wasn't left with the typical shiny look that I get from most sunscreens. It also wears fine under foundation. Wish I'd known about this product years ago!"," January 6, 2015"

I did re-apply after the first couple of hours, but got lazy after that and was later concerned i may have tempted fate by not applying a third application, but this sunscreen protected perfectly and i had absolutely no issues with my skin from it, not one clog, not one pimple, and my roscea stayed under control which has never happened when i get sunlight on my face.

I've never reacted well to sunscreens - chemical or mineral - but I'm super pale and need to protect my skin! Unfortunately, this had the same effect on my skin as any other sunscreen - major breakout. It also seems to run off very quickly, especially if walking around Nola in the summer for example... I will say, at least it didn't smell bad, went out light and non-greasy, and didn't feel itchy/burny while wearing."," July 27, 2017"

909,Crystal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this sunscreen on my oily skin,"  I have extremely oily skin. This mattifies my skin and wears beautifully under makeup without stinging my eyes. Other sunscreens leave me shiny immediately after application. The only downside of this sunscreen is the high price. As a result, I will only use this on special occasions, and not for every day."," September 22, 2021"
910,Bianca ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen for everyday,"  Been using this for more than 10 yrs. haven’t found any other product as good. It’s nice day light, disappears quickly. My skin feels smooth and I’ve noticed the sun spots and texture is so much better. I suffer from adult acne sometimes and this is the only sunblock I feel does not contribute to it, actually helps with it. I have oily t zone but living in Vegas, the dry air has helped, and this product moisturizes without leaving any oiliness."," August 3, 2018"

I have very fair skin and light eyes so I have to be really careful about sunscreens.  I like this because it's both a chemical and a physical sunscreen so it keeps me protected throughout the day quite well.  Also the zinc and niacinamide are soothing to my skin.  Sits great under my MAC studio fix makeup and there is no visible cast once you rub it in (and it rubs in so easily!)  You won't want to use anything else after this!," January 24, 2014"

The feeling is greasy and heavy and in the summer you won't have a heavy feeling from any product on your face. Your make up foundation or even just concealer under eyes looks bad. After trying out I bought a drugstore product for around $13 and this is so much better than elta md. I would not recommend this product to friends or anyone else."," November 16, 2015"

I work out hard, plus I am in my late 40's, so sweat is inevitable!  This one does the trick.  My sweat is still tinged white when it drips on the floor, so I know it is still on my face from the morning.  Once this is absorbed, there is no white cast on my skin.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  The bottle is lasting quite a while.  There is no way to tell how much is remaining, but that is no big deal."," September 26, 2013"
920,Megs13,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Protects against sunburn, but for sensitive skin claim may not be true for you","  This sunscreen was pleasant to apply - it didn't leave a white film on my face. It did protect my face from sunburn. However, it showed me the importance of being aware of what your skin is sensitive to when purchasing ""sensitive skin"" products. Since my skin reacts badly to niacinamide (which I didn't realize until using this sunscreen), this sunscreen gave me facial hives. I've never had my skin react to a product so intensely and painfully."," July 22, 2019"
921,Sophia,5.0 out of 5 stars,doesnt break me out! will buy forever!,"  First off, I live in Miami, FL and work promotions outside. My skin is as sensitive and acne prone as it gets, and every sunscreen I have EVER tried has caused me to break out in cystic acne. After doing my research on the ingredients and reviews, I purchases this sunscreen and I am so happy with it. I have been using it for two weeks with absolutely NO breakouts or irritation even when I am in direct sunlight. This sunscreen is so lightweight yet mositurizing, dries to a perfect matte finish, absorbs oil, and even without makeup, makes my skin look better. Also, it is 100% CLEAR and does not leave any residue. I have even stopped using primer before my foundation because this sunscreen works so well and makes my skin very smooth. Take it from a girl who has tried EVERY sunscreen out there whether it isNeutrogena to other high end or dermatologist brands. THIS IS THE BEST!!!"," June 22, 2013"

923,Karen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great light sunscreen!,"  I've been using this every morning under my make up. It's light and absorbs quickly. It hasn't caused breakouts (although my skin still flares up now and then, but it did that before I started using this - and the breakouts aren't as bad now.) I like that it's rated a 3 on Environmental Working Group for low toxicity. Overall I enjoy using this and my skin is protected throught the day. I don't think this would work for swimming and outdoor sport use, but for normal daily use it's perfect."," May 4, 2014"
924,ShaniAZ,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen in every way,"  Sunscreens are a daily necessity here in Phoenix.  Even though I tan easily and don't burn, I've always been careful about keeping away as much sun damage as I possibly could.  Through years of trial and error, I found my skin could not tolerate some of the most popular non-physical sunscreen ingredients (oxybenzone, PABA, Avobenzone,Octyl methoxycinnamate  etc.), plus, I have gotten terrible cystic acne when using a lotions and makeup with the physical/mineral sunscreen Titanium dioxide.  I am so, SO relieved to have found Elta MD with actives Zinc oxide and and Octinoxate,. Luckily, neither of those ingredients aggravates my skin, and they synergize to provide good broad spectrum protection.  It wasn't until I used Elta SPF 46 lotion, that I experienced a sunscreen product that has no side effects! (I've tried everything....).  Elta MD UV Clear does not irritate my skin, cause cystic acne, burn my eyes, or leak through makeup.  It smooths my skin, but it absorbs and dries quickly, and it doesn't add extra oil to my face.  Do I have a matte finish all day long?  No - but I don't think that's even possible. Foundation and/or setting powder work well with the SPF 46 lotion.  Another truly wonderful thing about this lotion is that it is fragrance-free.  I love perfumes...when I can control their application, and wear them when I'm in the mood for them.  When my skin care products are fragranced, they annoy my over-sensitivity to smells and often cause headaches and allergic reactions.Not having to worry about effecs from fragrances takes a lot off my mind. My doctor says to wear minimum SPF 30 every day to prevent discolorations and tanning, so I am very comfortable with the SPF 46 rating. As if the gentle, broad-spectrum SPF, and fragrance-free presentation wasn't enough, Elta MD SPF 46 also contains Niacinimide (cell-communicating), Sodium Hyaluronate (Moisture),Tocopheryl Acetate (antioxidant), and Lactic Acid (astringent).  This lotion has a light creamy finish that softened and absorbs nicely. It feels refreshing and soothing, and a little goes a long way. My husband and teenage sons will allow themselves to be forced by me into applying it,because it's so lightweight, easy to wear, scentless, and non-sticky. This is probably the most important product of all, at this time is my life, to help me keep some control on my own photoaging."," August 31, 2015"

This stuff is awesome, goes on clear, sets a nice stage for make-up, and leaves zero oily residue. I use many topical and oral prescriptions to keep my face breakout free which in turn makes it very sensitive, and this product does not irritate my face at all! The only negative is that the product does have a slight ""sunscreen smell"", however it isn't super strong and definitely is worth it!"," February 2, 2016"

I know others have reviewed that this seems to peel.....I've only seen that happen to me like 3 times.  The key for me is to not use a ton....which I know is kind of defeating the purpose.

938,Jim or Julia Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best for face,"  I have used this product regularly for several years, and my daughter now uses it also. In don't know what I'd do without it. When I first discovered it, I thought it was a revelation. Unlike other zinc sunscreens I notice almost no white cast, nor does it have the greasy feel common with all sunscreens, chemical or mineral, when used on the face--instead it feels just like a good moisturizer. I have not observed any skin problems while using this product. If it were not so expensive, I'd use it all over! I do often put some on the back of my hands.I just noticed some negative reviews, and wanted to add a comment. Everyone's body chemistry is different, and for any product out there, there are some people who are going to react to it. That is why you should spot test any product you are going to use on your face.  I also realize that some folks are concerned about the Octinoxate chemical sunscreen and the small size of the zinc particles. I'll admit these things are a tiny bit worrisome, but as with the question ""what form of exercise?"" the answer is ""the one you'll do"". If you want to protect your face from the sun, this is one you are likely to ""do"", not something heavy and clumping and white as the most ""all natural"" sunscreens tend to be. And hats and shade don't actually prevent as much UV from reaching your face as most people believe."," June 26, 2013"
939,Laura S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Does not burn or feel greasy, even when you sweat!","  Incredible!  I'm a young, fashion forward person who works outside in the sun, and sweats while working.  I don't want to wrinkle or get skincancer, and I've tried a number of ""sensitive skin"" products.  None work like Elta MD.  I needed a sunscreen that doesn't burn when your pores open up from the heat.  It's light, it doesn't feel oily at all, and it doesn't burn.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended.

I have acne prone skin that seems to reach to everything and this spf hasn’t caused me any issues.

Our family put it to the test this weekend as we were out all day in the sun and it was amazing! We did have to reapply, like you do with every single sunscreen, but it was still fabulous.

964,K.C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Non greasy. No sign of irritation,"  I love this sunscreen. It is totally non greasy and neutral for my skin. It can make my face slightly whiter but it doesn't bother me. I just did an acid peeling and I NEED sunscreen. This one protects my skin from breaking out(acne kinda skin) and sunburn. The only thing I am not quite satisfied with is that I have to apply a thick layer of it to make sure I won't leave any new skin under the sunlight. I believe, though, it can be used up pretty fast because of the amount of this product."," August 19, 2013"

It absorbs into my skin in seconds and leaves it ready for moisturizer, primer or even just a bit of concealer.  Doesn't make me break out in the slightest.  I've bought so many facial sunscreens, but this one just feels so light on my skin and absorbs so quickly that I actually love using it!

995,Stacey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Leatherface,"  I do want to give this product a bit more time for me to evaluate its effectiveness over the summer when my freckles usually get dark, but I can evaluate it based on my skin's reaction to it after a few days of use. I would say if you use this product, you should definitely make sure to use a good moisturizer. After three consecutive days of use, I looked like I had aged five years.  It dried my face up so much, that I could feel every facial movement, and every wrinkle seemed much deeper."," April 23, 2015"

997,BeautyMom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen to Wear Under Makeup,"  This is one of my favorite daily sunscreens on the market.  It absorbs quickly without leaving a whitish cast so that makeup application on top of it is very easy.  I love that it also contains great anti-aging ingredients like niacinamide to help brighten my skin.  I am a long time user of Japanese sunscreens because they provide high SPF protection while absorbing quickly.  Elta MD offers the same protection but without the high alcohol content of some of the Japanese brands.  This is a great sunscreen for those who have combination skin and want a high SPF, all day protection."," June 30, 2016"

1003,Sonia W,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent- better than neutrogena dry touch at keeping down acne,"  Pros:- great SPF coverage, tested on my melasma for the summer- it lasts (used it daily for at least 3 months and it's still going- cleared up my acne, even used under make-up- no white residue (neutrogena left white streaks and patches if I wasn't very careful)- I recommend to use it with a light moisturizer underneath and it still removes any shine- waaayy better than neutrogena dry touch sun blockCon:Can't tell how much is left in the bottleI have melasma and need full SPF coverage every day, even on cloudy days, to prevent dark patches on my face from forming. I used to use neutrogena dry touch SPF 80-100 daily for 11 years. I thought it was the only product out there that fit my needs. While it worked for keeping dark spots away, I continued to struggle with a shiny and acne prone complextion. So, I decided to search amazon reviews for something better. In on June 25, 2014 reviews led me to this sunscreen (Elta MD UV Clear). IT. IS. Awesome. I no longer have problems with shine, and my breakouts have been eliminated. Gone! Also, it does seem that my brown patches have improved, which is probably just the natural course of the melasma if it doesn't get more sun. I am writing this review just over 3 months later. I do also use a light moisturizer (oil of Olay daily moisturizer w SPF, which has need the same one for me for over a decade) under the EltaMD. A few days a go I tried using just the sunscreen alone, but found my skin was too dry. I'm not done with the botte yet, but I'm heading back to amazon today to buy another bottle just in case it runs out soon."," October 4, 2014"
1004,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work!,"  This sunscreen did nothing to protect my skin from burning. I am taking an antibiotic that makes me sunburn prone, & Blue Lizard Sensitive 30 worked wonders. Using the Elta  product offered no protection & I burned as if I hadn’t applied anything at all. Just missed my return window by two days, & disappointed that I’ll have to throw this money doesn’t down the drain."," April 13, 2021"
1005,DLC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Light, moisturizing SPF","  I bought this product because I needed something with SPF to wear every day. I found out I am more prone to skin cancer as I carry the BRCA2 gene, and as I have fair skin I knew it was more important for me to jump on the SPF train sooner rather than later. After reading many reviews for different products I decided on the EltaMD. It is absorbed quickly into the skin, moisturizes my skin and doesn't contribute to oiliness. I have combination skin and it definitely helps where it needs to help and doesn't make it worse in my trouble spots. I also have acne due to PCOS and it has not broken me out. I can't say that it has helped, but my acne is more hormone related than anything topical I can do to the skin, but at the very least it is not breaking me out unnecessarily. I love that it absorbs and dries quickly on the skin and doesn't add much time onto my daily beauty routine. I intend on wearing it every day even though I'm not out in the sun very much - prevention is key!"," October 19, 2012"

1012,Tracy,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen For your face.,"  I will be the first to admit I never have taken care of my skin. On the other hand I also do not know how to wear makeup. A little eyeliner and I am out the door! I'm 28. Recently after I had my son I've noticed some pesky lines and spots so I've decided to start a skin care regimen. My regimen consists only of washing my face, applying moisturizer, and finally sunscreen. I have combination skin. Oily T-zone. During the winter a bit dry. Of course I get the occasional acne too. I've tried several facial sunscreens that are oil free and for acne prone skin. They all felt very heavy, left my face very shiny and even more oily. After reading reviews decided to give this a try. What I like is its in a pump. One little squirt does the trick so no waste. The color is a light cream color but rubs on clear. It feels so light weight on my skin and does not look shiny at all! I've only had it a few days but so far am so very impressed. I haven't had a breakout yet and I almost always do when trying new products. If you want a nice light weight, non greasy, non fragrant sunscreen this is what you need!"," August 28, 2015"

I either end up with breakouts, a pink nose and cheeks, or more freckles.....this sunscreen is light, yet has a high SPF. I use it every day and have purchased this three or four times so far.  I would recommend this sunscreen!  It's not your every day $8 sunscreen from a drug store. There are high quality ingredients in this sunscreen to account for the price.  And this sunscreen does not make my face burn either!"," October 18, 2011"

1021,Denisse,3.0 out of 5 stars,I'm unsure about this product...,"  I gave it a three and not a four because I feel that it leaves a sort of film on my face. When I apply makeup or moisturizer over it, the sunscreen seems to peel off in crumbs. Maybe it's a reaction to the mixing of products. I'm not sure. As for its sun blocking properties? I can't really say! I use it every day, even with the peeling. It's not very moisturizing, so I add moisturizer over it. Overall, I feel it's ""eh.""

I'm a 55 yr. old male with  a mild case of Rosacea that has dramatically improved as a result of using elta clear. I tried the UV Shield 45 which is a great product as well but after several weeks of use the Rosacea came back. I use the 45 on other areas of exposed skin and reserve the UV Clear for my face. Between the two I'm confident I get  protection from the sun while experiencing ""break-out"" free skin. My dermatologist recommended UV clear, I'm eternally grateful.

1090,stuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Feels like moisturizer, works like sunscreen","  I love this stuff! It really feels like a moisturizer, not a sunscreen, and doesn't smell like sunscreen either. It has never broken me out, made me feel greasy, or effected the look of makeup. It's also really hard (for some reason) to find sunscreens with decent ingredients, but this one is great.I loved it right away, but didn't want to review it until I knew it was effective. It feels so much like a moisturizer, that it was hard to believe it would actually block the sun. Well - I wore this, and only this (not even makeup) on my face for a day out in the sun recently. I got red on my shoulders, neck, and everywhere else up top that I didn't have sunscreen on, but my face was completely unphased.There's really something to be said for the feel/smell of something like this. I didn't think I would care much, but the fact that it feels good on my skin actually motivates me to wear it every day. It has also lasted a long time. I ordered this March 8th, and it's now August 3rd and I'm still on my first bottle. One pump is just a little bit more than I need to cover my whole face.The packaging is great too. I love that it's a pump (that works well) and has a cap that actually stays on. That, and the size of the bottle, make it easy for me to keep in my purse so there's no excuse to be without it."," August 3, 2016"

1092,Denise,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go to sunscreen,"  Good, hygienic packaging with an easy to use pump. I got this because I have acne prone skin, and in the past, have suffered sunscreen-induced zits for sun protection. I'm so happy I found a dermatologist recommended sunscreen for this price.The white cast is very slight, barely noticeable. It's got a just-right consistency--not too runny like Biore Aquarich and not too tacky and thick like Alba Botanicas or Derma E.My skin feels a bit dry after using it, but it's nothing a bit of face lotion won't fix."," January 29, 2018"
1093,JO,4.0 out of 5 stars,For oily skin,  This is the best sunscreen for my oily face! I put on moisturizer first then this sunscreen because it is rather drying.

1094,Heather Bailey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial sunscreen for my rosacea,"  The dermatologist recommended this after I had a laser treatment for rosacea and I needed to be out of the sun for 4-6 weeks. Well, I was going to Florida the following week, so that was difficult. I used this every 2 hours. It not only kept the sun off my face, my skin was amazingly clear (and not just from the laser treatment) after just a week. Plus, it’s so moisturizing, I just use this without an additional moisturizer."," October 14, 2019"

1096,AmazonCustomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"  I have very oily, acne prone skin, and I have to be very careful about which products I use.  Even many products that are marketed as non-comedogenic or for acne prone skin will cause me to break out.  Sunscreens in particular are problematic for me, even those that claim they won't clog pores or cause breakouts.I am truly, truly amazed by this stuff!  I have been using it for about a month now, and I am so surprised that it has not caused me a single breakout!  I'm shocked, really.  Not only has my face remained clear while using the EltaMD Clear, but it also seems less oily.  (Granted I still have excessively oily skin, but less so with this.)I don't mean to be so superfluous, but I truly am amazed with this stuff.  I always thought I would have to choose between acne or sun-damaged skin.  It really is a relief to know I can get sun protection without breaking out."," October 10, 2012"

It goes on smoothly under makeup as well.  The best part: it's great with my super oily skin and doesn't cause any breakouts like most sunscreens tend do on my skin.  I love the fact that it has antioxidants so that it does double duty.  With the price being so reasonable (compared to other sunscreens), I don't hesitate slathering this stuff :-)"," September 2, 2013"

I am super sensitive to UV since I started retina A, and this stuff really protects me from the intense Southern sun. It is the ONLY sunscreen that does not break me out.

1109,Chanel Liberatore,2.0 out of 5 stars,Broke out like crazy :(,"  I don’t have sensitive skin at all but definitely acne prone which is why I bought this particular product. Anything with spf has always made me break out. Well this one is no different. I got pimples everywhere on my face from it and a few cystic ones I haven’t had for years. I take very good care of my skin and cleanse properly so I’ll have to stop using this and maybe save it for my neck, chest or body."," October 2, 2019"
1110,aalaman,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bottle/packaging are horrible,"  I love this, but please go back to the previous container. The ""new"" container with the dome-like top with the circle hole in it IS THE PITS! I have to pump over and over to get any sunscreen out. And when I do, sometimes it's a little, other times nothing, other times almost next to nothing. It operates almost as though it is close to empty, like you are just getting the last little bit out. But it's brand new. It's really ridiculous packaging. I hate to switch, but this really isn't convenient or user friendly for the consumer."," July 8, 2016"

1113,akya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love this product.,"  Growing up I never really dealt with acne breakout. Maybe just one or two tiny ones every few months, nothing to complain about. It wasn't til I was about 26 years old that my face became a mess. After learning that what I have was hormonal acne from my dermatologist, and that roughly 25% of all Asian female adults experience this, I was pretty bummed out. Getting older, my face became extremely sensitive to everything. It's now sensitive, combo skin but more on the dry side. I tried so many different SPF product from Olay, Aveeno, Neutrogen, and the expensive $100 Lancome SPF. They either made my face a bit oily throughout the day and caused me to breakout. And of course I didn't like the smell or the thickness of SPF. But I really wanted to wear SPF to prevent high-pigmentation dark spots (occurs a lot for Asians) and wrinkles. I struggled for many years trying to find an SPF that will work for me.My coworker, knowing about my skin problem, gave me a sample of ELTA MD SPF for ""Dry and Post-Procedure Skin"". I tried the sample and loved it. So I found this product recommended for acne-prone skin. I was a bit worried that it might be too different from the Post-Procedure Skin but it's the same. Both have no smell, super super light and easy to spread on my face (spread a thin amount!), and does not make my face oily throughout the day. I have been using it for two weeks and it does not make me breakout. Usually I can tell after a few days if the product makes me break out or not (like the various products indicated above). Of course I still get the occasional breakout when I'm close to my monthly, but I know for sure this product is not the cause of it. The ELTA's SPF active ingredients are completely different from the products indicated above. I really believe those other SPF ingredients are the reason why it causes me to breakout.Bottle Review: I thought I would not like the pump after reading the reviews regarding the pump having issues, but mine work perfectly. It pushes out a perfect amount for my face so I don't feel like I'm wasting product. The bottle seems small for the price, but after using it, it's actually pretty perfect. Because the pump doesn't give you a huge amount, the product should last for a while (also compare to Lancome, this price is awesome!). Also, the small bottle is perfect for throwing it in your purse or travel bag.I highly recommend this product and hope my review help you find the product that works for you!!"," June 19, 2015"

It has the best feel for a sunscreen on my face out of all the hundreds I've tried. Zero sticky, tacky or heavy feel with this product. It feels so theraputic putting on my face and neck. I use it daily rain or shine first thing in the morning. All my other makeup goes on so smooth and flawless. Love love love it!"," March 19, 2014"
1121,Hailey Easley,5.0 out of 5 stars,It doesn't break me out and works great under makeup!,"  I'm a 26 year old lady with sensitive, acne prone skin. I have been reluctant to start using anything regularly because of the breakouts sunscreen has given me since my teenage years. Every ""specially formulated for face"" sunscreen that I've tried has protected me (and my acne scars) from the sun while creating new acne and new spots of hyper-pigmentation left by my acne. After wrangling my acne problem I have been determined to protect my skin and finally came upon this sunscreen. It protects me from the sun, keeps my skin clear, works great under makeup, leaves my skin feeling great (and not greasy), and doesn't leave me with a gray cast. I'm really happy with this product."," May 3, 2015"
1122,D Chandler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only sunscreen that works for me,"  EltaMd UV Clear SPF 46 was recommended by my dermatologist because my skin is very sensitive and becomes very red around the nose and mouth with many products.  Also, I couldn't find a sun screen that would prevent the brown spots on my face.  I have used this product daily for 2 months now and love that I have no redness and no brown spots!Note that I originally tried EltaMD broad spectrum SPF 40 tinted formula, but it turned my face red.  I loved that it was tinted, so now I make a ""cocktail"" of my sunscreen by adding a drop of my liquid foundation to the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 and mix it together in the palm of my hand before applying.  It's perfect, eliminating any white shadow that can occur with sunscreens and giving me a healthy glow.Lastly, this product is rich and only takes a very small amount for coverage.  That is way I do not hesitate to spend the extra dollars, because it last much longer than the over-the-counter products."," June 25, 2014"
1123,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight but a bit greasy.,"  This is an ok sunscreen. It was recommended by my friend who had it recommended by her dermatologist.

1124,ChristineMM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps Me Not Burn - Living in Houston - Dry - One Bottle Per Month - Daily Use,"  The other doctor-sold creme failed for me in the summer months as it let my face burn and created permanent sunburn damage on my nose. I switched to this 18 months ago and it works great.I use one pump in the morning which covers my face, neck, and chest area. It goes on dry feeling and is not sticky.I have very sensitive skin and many cremes and sunscreens make me break out with a lot of little red dots all over or with pimples. I have been fine with this.For touch-ups I found a tan colored face powder with SPF 50 that is a different brand that lasts 80 minutes. I touch up with that powder throughout the day and other than intense long days in the direct sun without a hat I remain unburned.This bottle lasts me exactly one month with two squirts a day. If you think it is expensive go price the laser treatments to fix permanent sunburn damage, it will run you about two thousand dollars.I love this = 5 stars."," October 7, 2014"

It also goes on smoothly and blends into the skin quickly so there's no white residue.So why did I only give it 3 stars?  The container holds a small amount for the price since the pump stopped working after 2 weeks of use I can't say it was worth the money.  The top will not unscrew so there's no way to get the remaining lotion out and when I shake the bottle there doesn't seem to be very much left.

1158,Coffee Lover,4.0 out of 5 stars,the better face sunscreen so far...,"  I tried a lot of face sunscreen that doesn't have that sunscreen greasy feel. I tried the skincare brands from department stores only to be disappointed by the greasiness. This eltamd is the best so far. I use it in place of my moisturizer, minimizes my pores, and I can use it on my eyelids. I got a shade darker with this when I was playing tennis for an hour. But my face wasn't greasy in the end. I'll be buying more of this stuff."," January 24, 2013"
1159,Alyssa,5.0 out of 5 stars,So pleased!,"  My dermatologist recommended this product for me and gave me samples to try before I buy. I have never worn a sun-protecting lotion that did not feel greasy or heavy on my skin. This, for me, is a winner. Finally, I have a sunscreen lotion that feels light AND doesn't give me breakouts (I have a huge problem with acne and breakouts. Hence, that is why my dermatologist told me to purchase this.). Bottom line, I'm very happy with it, and the price isn't bad, either. I have shelled out too many dollars for skincare products that don't work, and this is worth my dollar. I only hope that many others will find it as helpful for their skin as it has been for mine.P.S. I am currently using this in conjunction with Glytone Step-Up Mild Cream Wash. Also, a wonderful product, in my opinion."," October 8, 2012"

I think the niacinimide is actually helping to even my complexion because I've gotten compliments and my no-makeup selfies look better! The bottle lasts several months too.

My dermatologist started me out with the Obagi suncreen, then the Elta MD regular and then the Neova waterproof.  While all of these products were great as sunscreens, they all caused me to have major problems with breakouts and tons of blackheads.  I switched over to this product and my skin has been flawless ever since.  This does not cause me to have breakouts, or have all of those blackheads I was getting from other sunscreens.  Even though I am 56 years old, my skin is still very oily.  This does not leave my face greasy and works well under my makeup.I read the online reviews prior to ordering and saw where some people were concerned about the authenticity of the product.  This is exactly the same as the product I bought from my dermatologist.  It is also the one that is for rosacea, pigmentation and acne prone skin."," September 15, 2015"

1225,Violetta,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fix Pump Seal with Tape,"  SUNSCREEN: 5 stars. It's a nice compromise between a purely chemical sunscreen (which I'm trying to avoid) and a purely physical sunscreen that often shows up with a white cast or pills under makeup. Also has niacinamide, which is nice since it's good to layer different products with nicacinamide since they often don't appear in effective concentrations within any one product.PACKAGING: 1 star for the terrible airless pump, which doesn't seal correctly (and caused some of the product to leak during shipment). The pump quit working on my second use. I was able to fix it by placing tape around the joint (area above the label) to fix the vacuum seal, but it's still annoying the packaging isn't manufactured correctly."," December 2, 2015"

1236,Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin!,"  I love this product.  It was prescribed by my dermatologist.  I was hesitant because my skin is sensitive and breaks out easily.  Not only is it gentle on my skin, but it also helps to prevent break outs because it is a physical sunblock as opposed to a chemical sunblock.  In the summer, I don't need an additional moisturizer.  In the winter my dry skin does require additional moisture but this is great for everyday use!"," November 23, 2017"

It felt as though I had gotten a pretty bad sunburn on my face.I did not use it for about a month as I am not great about applying sunscreen daily unless I am really spending a lot of time in the sun.  I have been trying to find a daily sunscreen to use because I know that I should be using one... so, I tried this again three days ago in hopes that I might be able to start using it daily.I was inside the entire day and did not spend any time in the sun.  That night my face was red, tight, burning, my skin was puffy all over my cheeks and around my eyes.  My skin was hot to the touch again, as though I had a sunburn, which was impossible.  I had applied no other different products than usual besides this sunscreen.  It took another two days for the redness and heat to leave.  I will never use this product again, which is a shame because it was quite expensive."," August 25, 2017"

I have pale, sensitive skin that burns easily.  In addition, it goes on smooth and non-greasy so you don't even feel like you are wearing anything,  Even after a full day on the river, rafting, my skin was not burned. It is not drying and has not caused any breakouts.  I use it on my face, neck, chest and shoulders.  I am very happy with this product."," June 28, 2014"

Also, they do not blend into my brown skin, giving an ashen appearance. This lotion is light, blends, is matte and works well under make up. I tend to be oily and this moisturizes while keeping my skin matte and calm. Great daily face lotion and holds up well while excersising outdoors."," September 9, 2015"

I get mostly air and no product! I bought two bottles at the time, so this will be a costly lesson if the pumps don't work. I contacted the manufacturer and EltaMD said that they do not communicate with consumers, so you're only recourse is to talk to your seller. They curtly added that they only accept returns from authorized sellers who are almost exclusively medical practices and medically supervised spas.  No response on whether the pump changed.

It does a great job without being overly oily nor does it leave one with a ""white"" cast.  It's a great moisturizer for my 50+ year old skin as well.  No breakouts or irritation, it simply works.

The guys I work with don't bother--or haven't rather, perhaps having pegged sun protection as a vanity issue--then inevitably scurry to do so once the docs start hacking pieces off their ears, lips, or nose due to the insideous and unfortunate melanoma prevalent amongst those of us with outdoor occupations...Appreciate it's mild moisturizing quality plus decent 46 sun protection potency and typically apply it up to three times (or every two/three hours as per bottle instructs), on any given workday out in the (construction) field.Drugstore brands, though obviously less expensive, leave me with disgusting, aggravating, cystic acne skin each-and-every time, but not this stuff, thank goodness!True, it's is not particularly sheer or transparent, at least upon initial application, however that's okay by me as it tames down my otherwise ruddy or rather weather beaten face (disregarded sunscreen use when younger), with a ""lighter"", hence, younger hue and again, offers a more moist or dewy, perhaps glistening appearance than I would otherwise have as a ""mature"" 51 year old woman with a lifelong occupation in the trades.Thanks guys and keep making this stuff! :)"," May 1, 2016"

It's super light weight and non-greasy.  My face doesn't break out.  I don't recommend using it too close to the eye area. I had a reaction when I put it too close to my eyes.

I'm a bit of a sunscreen enthusiast, and with such great reviews and ingredients I was expecting this to become one of my favorites. However, this just doesn't sink nicely into skin. It goes on clear which is great, but it balls up into little white flakes, and basically flakes off the skin. The application isn't so bad if you apply to straight to clean, dry skin with no moisturizer...but moisturizer is a must for me. Big disappointment considering the price."," August 10, 2015"

Even on days that I am outdoors a lot, it still does a great job of sun protection, without needing to re-apply.

I finally decided to try it -- and am so glad I did! It's honestly the best facial sunscreen that I have ever used!The formulation is very smooth and elegant, and it doesn't have any of that awful sunscreen smell or tackiness to it. It also plays well with other products; each morning, I apply my Paula's Choice antioxidants and let them sink in for a minute, then I apply this and let it sink in, and then I apply my foundation/makeup. It doesn't cause pilling or balling with your foundation.It also doesn't leave a white cast the way other foundations sometimes do, and I really appreciate the high SPF since I've had some pre-cancerous spots removed.It's a lovely product!"," August 31, 2014"

1299,Allison M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, clear, thin, clean, dries -- BUY THIS!","  This is the most amazing face lotion I've ever tried AND it has SPF 46.  I have acne-prone skin and fair complexion, so it's very difficult to find a face lotion that works well for me. Most lotions feel oily or sticky or make my face shiny and greasy all day.  I have been using a Cetaphil lotion for awhile and that works well, but is only SPF 15.  This lotion is exactly as advertised and like the reviews I read: it goes on clear. It dries immediately. It is very thin. You don't need a lot--a pea size is a little more than I need to cover my face.  This lotion moisturizes but feels like I'm not wearing any lotion.  I've never had a face lotion feel that way and don't know how they do it.I work out hard every morning, so after my shower, it takes awhile to cool off.  I can put this lotion on and it still dries, even though my body hasn't cooled down.  I also swim frequently.  For anyone that swims, you know that after you get out of the pool and maybe take a shower, your face feels very taught.  After putting a little of this lotion on, my face feels normal, but is still dry to the touch.Lastly, the price.  Yes, it seems a little high, but in the grander scheme of things, it is absolutely worth it.  I need a good moisturizer with high SPF to wear on a daily basis and this fits the bill.  My skin is also prone to hyperpigmentation, which is hard to undo and can become embarrassing on a professional level.  I work outside sometimes and I also enjoy being outside as much as possible.  If I'm going to be in the direct sun all day, I will add another SPF 85-100 lotion on top of this.  Otherwise, this is plenty and I've been very pleased to see my skin protected from a product I forget I'm wearing.  Also, I learned my dermatologist office swears by this line of products. Last time I was there, we had a good chat about why they love  them and that reinforced my reasons for buying this."," April 4, 2016"

However, I've been guilty in the past of neglecting to wear sunscreen on my face to avoid the usual clogged pores and/or breakout that follows. This product has proven to be a miracle sunscreen for my face.  With SPF 46, it fully protects my skin from the damaging rays of the sun and has never left my skin feeling greasy or my pores clogged.  Furthermore, it has never caused my face to breakout.  It provides all of the protection you could ask for without the devastating results of many over-the-counter general sunscreens.  My dermatologist first recommended this product after I had a blemish, which had darkened dramatically during pregnancy, lasered off of my face.  However, because I have sensitive skin that is susceptible to breakouts, I have continued to purchase this product for my daily use facial sunscreen.  In addition, I have started to use this sunscreen as facial protection on my 1 and 3-year-old children because it has high SPF protection, but doesn't irritate their eyes like most sunscreens if they rub their eyes after application."," January 28, 2016"

It applies very easily and stays put with no greasy shine on my oily skin. I don't use it for daily use however due to the faint white cast on my light/medium olive tone skin."," July 16, 2017"

1319,Vanessa ALbert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes.,"  Best SPF I have ever used.  I have tried a bazillion different types of SPF lotions/creams and always find them to be irritating and either way too drying or way too greasy feeling.  I paid an arm and a leg for a few shiseido brand SPF moisturizers such as the Ultimate Sun Protection (in the blue and orange bottle) and the Urban Environment Protectant (white bottle) after reading reviews on Sephora raving about the products.  IMO, they were too watery for my liking, pilled, and irritated/dried out my skin.  I have combination/dry/sensitive skin and have lived with eczema my whole life.  I've also tried a few Aveeno SPF products and have always had the same reaction.  Halfway through the day, I just feel dirty.  (I know a lot of yall have felt that way before too with SPF products! Let's be real!)  And want to wash everything off bc the SPF is so uncomfortable and I can feel it sitting on my skin.Anywho, I have been trying different retinol serums and AHA/BHA exfoliants, so I need to make sure I'm applying SPF whenever I go outside (even if just for a few minutes).  I apply this after cleansing/moisturizing.  Absorbs quickly and does not make me feel greasy or dry.  Haven't noticed any white cast or pilling either.  I would compare the texture to the Aveeno daily SPF moisturizers that come with a pump.  Kind of thick but surprisingly not heavy once applied.  My skin is not complaining! Highly recommend!"," February 4, 2016"

1321,Imani,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Meant for People of Color,"  This sunscreen is great... if you’re white. Was excited to finally find a facial sunscreen that was moisturizing and wouldn’t leave me looking like a ghost. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While subtle, this sunscreen will give you a white cast over your skin and leave you looking dull. My skin is ordinarily vibrant, vibrant and glowy. Immediately after applying this on my face it looks dull and discolored. Try another sunscreen that is completely clear onto your skin."," May 27, 2019"

1332,Avid Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,3 and 4 Stars ....,"  I give this product a 3 Star and a 4 Star. How is that possible? Confusing I know. Here are my reasons for the 3 Star Rating. Since I began using this at the prompting of the dermatologist my skin has dried out significantly. I tend to have sensitive skin and have to be careful with what I use. However, I did start with some other topical treatments a few days before starting the Elta Clear. I didn't have any issues with those products, so don't know if it's a build up, or a combination of those with the Elta Clear. I have a follow up with the dermatologist in a couple of weeks and will discuss with them, which, if any, of all of the new topicals may be causing the dryness.Reasons for the 4 Star Rating. I have not spent a ton of time outdoors since beginning to use this product, but I am outside more than I was before. That being said, so far, I have not had any burns. That is significant because my tendency is to burn, blister, peel, and burn again."," April 10, 2014"

1335,A. Spence,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,"  I would give it 5 stars but the price knocks it down one. The pump action makes it convenient to dispense the right amount without waste. It goes on clean and I do not breakout. Sunscreen in the past after a few hours starts to feel slick on skin however Elta MD does not. I like that it is just sunscreen and not moisturizer sunscreen which does not provide enough coverage on my fair skin. If you super fair like me, then this sunscreen is worth the investment."," April 27, 2013"
1336,Emily R. Gilley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not great","  This is a decent sunscreen, but it will not become my holy grail.  I do like that I can wear it over my Cetaphil and my skin feels comfortable and does not react or break out.  It is too drying for me by itself, though, and it does not have a high enough PPD to wear in the summertime, so it is going to be my winter sunscreen, but come spring I'll be on the hunt again."," October 4, 2014"

This stuff is very lightweight, so I've actually been using it daily for almost 2 months now. I haven't noticed any difference in the appearance of my skin but I didn't buy it for that purpose.

It feels rich, blends in well and works nicely with my face moisturizer. There is little to no white ""cast"" on the skin, but that may be partially due to my paleness. Because of the price, I only use it on my face/neck. I wish it weren't so expensive, but having tried other brands (including La Roche and Neutrogena, among others) I'm really happy with it."," August 16, 2014"

After moving to sunny California and spending a ton more sun outside, I started to notice a few more freckles popping up on my super pale skin. This combined with entering my late twenties and I decided it was high time to get real about wearing sunscreen every day. I heard great things about Eltamd and decided to try it out and I'm so glad I did. I've been wearing this every day since and I totally love it. Goes on well under makeup or just on it's own. I've also tried the Eltamd UV Physical SPF 41 which has a slight tint to it and is also quite lovely.Top pros:1. No white cast, easy to blend in2. Light, not greasy, feels like regular moisturizer on the skin3. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin - my skin actually feels less red and calmer after I apply it4.

1358,R. Gardner,4.0 out of 5 stars,No oily residue,"  This product was recommended by a dermatologist.  It goes on as a white cream that quickly absorbs into the skin with none of that oily residue feel that nearly all other sun screens have.  It is prohibitively expensive but you don't need to use very much.  One squirt seems to cover the essential areas of the face.  If you can afford it, I recommend it.

I have very sensitive skin and this product is light weight, absorbs quickly, isn’t greasy or oily, and never makes me break out. I wear it daily under my make up or by itself and because the zinc oxide is microionized, you don’t that white cast in photographs.  Having that physical blocker added to the sunscreen also means I don’t have to reapply as often.

1375,C. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First time user, very pleased","  This is the perfect product for my very dry skin. It adds a brightness and smooth texture so that I don't need foundation on most days. It is great for dry winter climates (upper Midwest). I did not notice any improvement in my hormonal acne, but I use other products for that. I also like that it is a physical sunscreen and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all, even though it does contain one chemical sunscreen. Other chemical sunscreens cause a burning sensation. In summary, this is a great moisturizing sunscreen for sensitive skin and it has a nice finish for applying foundation over it, almost like a primer. I will definitely always have this product in my cabinet."," December 31, 2016"

1392,Marty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect sunscreen for men,"  This is the first sunscreen I've found that overcomes all of my specific objections. I wish it were much less expensive. But here's what it does that no other sunscreen can match:1) It leaves a dry matte finish on my skin. No oily coat that looks like makeup and leaches into my eyes.2) It is remarkably transparent. Other products suggest they they, too, use ""invisible"" micronized zinc particles. But every other one I've tried leaves a noticeable white coat on my face.3) It can go on my scalp! I can blend it up into my thinning hairline.The shine of other products just looks like grease when it gets on my hair. Exactly what every man wants: a greasy scalp with flat hair that sticks to your reflective noggin. But this ""dry finish"" is the feature I've been trying to find for years, and it's why I pay Elta's high price. I can smear it over my bald spot and thin patches...and it looks like nothing. My hair still stands up. My hair and scalp look exactly like they did moments earlier. No better. But not worse. I have strong protection without looking like an old Brylcreem ad."," August 13, 2013"
1393,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t burn your eyes,"  I have melasma due to lack of sunscreen use throughout the years. This is a sunscreen that is at my dermatologists office. It is not oily or thick. It feels more like a light lotion or moisturizer then a sunscreen and it absorbs well. I put it on every morning before I put on makeup or on the weekends, every 2 hrs when I’m not wearing makeup and in the sun; walking the dog, yard work, pool etc."," March 11, 2018"

I will be honest as though $20 is a great price for this product compared to other venders it is a steep price for just a lotion with SPF qualities.  But if you want to splurge on yourself you will not be let down with the way that your this product makes your facial skin feel in a short time.

1403,Katie M,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST FACIAL SUNSCREEN EVER,"  For those that have searched for a magical face sunscreen that doesn't irritate acne, create a white film over your face, make your face look greasy, or smell like pina coladas, fear not!  This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist, and I can say that it is definitely worth the price.  First off, I have problem skin so I am already paying a ridiculous amount of money for products that are meant to keep your skin clear and the number one rule that dermatologists give you is to wear sunscreen... but that is usually such an issue because it normally counteracts all of my ridiculously expensive product by clogging my pores and irritating my acne. This sunscreen does neither.  It was created for people with sensitive or acne prone skin so it actually helps and works with your acne products.  It's also a great moisturizer!  It doesn't leave a film, though at first you may feel like your skin is oily (that's just how it looks/feels at first).  It also works, and everyone compliments me on my glow- little do they know that I actually protect my skin and create an artificial glow with bronzer.  You only need a small amount and it last forever.  I've been using it everyday since August and I still have some left.  For everyone still not convinced, please note that you will not look like a tourist if you wear this to the beach- believe me, everyone always asks if I am wearing sunscreen at all, or if I need to reapply because you CANNOT TELL THAT I AM WEARING IT.  Lastly, it acts as the perfect primer for your makeup.  I wear it everyday, regardless of whether or not I am wearing makeup that day, and nothing runs/smears/does something nasty.  BUY IT.  Your skin will thank you."," November 29, 2011"
1404,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding,"  So far this is the only sunscreen I can tolerate. It's very light in weight, so I don't feel as if my skin can't breath when applying it.

I've been using this brand for 3 years, so far Alta MD doesn't have any competition when it comes to transparency & weight."," November 2, 2015"

It doesn't irritate my skin and doesn't leave me in blemishes and that says a lot. The problem a lot of people have is sunscreens breaking them out, being too heavy and greasy but I can say that this sunscreen doesn't do any of those. It's very lightweight and it helps calm any redness you have. It is a little more expensive then your usual drugstore sunscreen but I can tell you that it's worth it. Definitely give it a shot if you're looking for a new sunscreen that's lightweight and won't break you out."," January 3, 2016"

Can anyone else share how full their bottle was upon arrival?The sunscreen itself is lightweight and doesn't bother my skin (after 2 uses) and protects very well. After 2 hours in direct sunlight with the UV index between 6-8, my face was still very white that evening.

It was recommended by my dermatologist and I've been using it for about 6 months.I put sunscreen on my face every day (often twice a day) and so it was vital to me to find a good, non-greasy sunscreen. This does the trick. Some people have said that it leaves a white sheen, but I haven't noticed anything like that (though I'm rather pale).The tubes last me about 2 months, even with regular and thorough application."," June 23, 2014"
1474,Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sunscreen,"  Recommended by my dermatologist. Goes on slightly white but quickly disappears, great protection, and does not burn my eyes or skin."," November 6, 2019"

1476,Mengyao Shi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sun screen ever,"  Best sun screen ever! I usually use sun screens from Japan for non greasy feeling. This one beats all I tried before. I have dry combination skin for your information, and this sun screen moisture my face well without whitening it. No alcohol smell, goes well with my foundation. Five star!"," August 24, 2019"
1477,Chakra44,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clearly a winner!,"  Wonderful feel to this sunscreen. It absorbs easily and no white cast. Easy to apply makeup over and moisturizing enough for me not to need anything else (but I am oily). Best of all, I feel completely protected in the CA sun!"," December 6, 2017"
1478,mj,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT SUNSCREEN FOR SENSITIVE/ACNE PRONE SKIN,"  This is the best sunscreen that I have used on my sensitive/acne prone skin.  Actually believe that it helps keep it clear & less irritated.  One pump is enough for my face, neck & chest.  I sometimes feel a bit oily on my face when I initially apply, but if I blot and/or apply face powder I have no problems the rest of the day.  This sunscreen was recommended to me about a year ago, but I decided to stick with Obagi Nu-Derm.  I like Obagi, but like I said I believe this sunscreen helps calm & keep my skin clear, which I can't say about the other."," May 14, 2013"
1479,K. Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magic Miracle Moisturizer,"  I bought this magic bottle in March right before we took engagement pictures. Friends. It is DECEMBER. I have just a couple more pumps left, so I'm ordering some. So there's that, it lasts forever. Also, breakouts with this stuff? Not happening. It calms my skin and after years of having red cheeks, it's a miracle! Buy yourself some, you will not regret."," December 6, 2013"
1480,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for active outdoor adventures but still ok.,"  I've heard a lot of good reviews about this sunscreen so I decided to check it out. I think it's pretty ok and I liked that it didn't feel like typical, greasy sunscreen. Some things I didn't like about it were:-Stung my sensitive skin, especially after reapplication.-The sunscreen ""pills"" up when you rub it, almost like dead skin.-It didn't hold up on my most recent hike after multiple reapplications and I ended up with a burnt face. I wouldn't recommend this for people who do sports or any intense outdoor activities like hiking/biking/etc."," April 20, 2016"

1483,AngelaL,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but leaves my skin oily","  My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for me, as I have acne-prone, sensitive skin with rosacea. It seems like a good product, but it exacerbates my skin's oiliness, and I look like an oilslick when I wear it. I end up having to blot every hour throughout the day to reduce the shine."," March 10, 2016"
1484,Stefanie W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Sunscreen!,"  This is a really great product.  It's very light, sheer, and non-greasy.  I am even able to put it on my eyelids (yes, I know you aren't really supposed to do that, but I don't want tanned eyelids) without irritation.  Can't speak to whether it actually clears up acne, but it definitely doesn't cause breakouts, and it's great under makeup or tinted moisturizer."," October 18, 2013"

1491,Miriam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great with Acne Meds,"  This sunscreen was recommended to me by a dermatologist and I love it.  It has the best sunblock agents in it because the zinc oxide is a physical barrier to the sun and the octinoxate is a chemical barrier.  It also has an anti-inflammatory agent in it, so if you are using acne meds that irritate your skin, this helps cool the redness.It is lighter than other sunscreens I have tried with zinc oxide (like Shiseido); it rubs in better, and washes off more easily.  Also, the price here is the best I have seen."," December 13, 2011"

1496,sl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price,"  This feels great on my face and provides good protection from the sun. It is very smooth to apply, I can't feel it when it is on, and it is not shiny.

1499,Oniskers,3.0 out of 5 stars,Treats and protects your skin!,"  Delivery:I gave this product three stars because some of the contents of the bottle were inside of the cap. Product is either used or damaged during shipment, although I believe it can't be the latter since the cap is undamaged. I would return it if i didnt need this sunscreen today.Product:Now let's talk about the fun part: Elta MD's clear sunscreen with niacinamide! If you're acne-prone or have acne marks/hyperpigmentation you want niacinamide on your face. Unless of course your face doesn't like it (patch test just in case).Acne marks/hyperpigmentation on your skin grow darker in the sun. This product protects you from the sun AND lightens the mark as you wear it! Niacinamide is MAGIC.Application:If you have very oily/normal skin, I suggest applying this on a bare face. If you have any dry patches or your skin is tight (like me) moisturize first and let that sink in. Now you can put EltaMD clear on. Wait 15 mins before applying your makeup. Be gentler than usual when you apply your makeup so the sunscreen stays in place.*2hrs later*As you've probably read before, sunscreen needs to be reapplied throughout the day. With this sunscreen it's easy to reapply with your makeup on. When it's time to reapply I first press drops of grapeseed oil on dry patches on my skin and let that sink in. Then you apply the sunscreen with small tapping motions rather than rubbing it in to keep your makeup in place. I spritz myself with some hydration tonic by blissoma and I'm good to go!"," April 18, 2017"
1500,C,5.0 out of 5 stars,best sunscreen on market &  no white face!,"  I used to be in the spa industry so I'm still obsessed with skincare and maintenance. This is hands down the best spf I've ever used. Doesn't clog pores, feel sticky or make me want to touch my face. Its feels light yet hydrating on and is sheer. LOVE IT and could not live without. I buy in two's. Just in case.Don't want to ever run out."," October 19, 2013"
1501,A. Cobb,5.0 out of 5 stars,works great - no allergies here,"  No allergic reaction with this stuff!!!  Most sunscreens seem to contain Oxybenzone, which I am allergic too.This SPF goes on nicely, no need to rub all day long to get the white gone, it's quickly absorbed.  Works well, haven't gotten even a little pink while using it."," September 19, 2016"

As someone with extremely oily skin who has struggled with the guilt of not wanting to use sunscreen to add to the oiliness, it is a relief to know this product exists. I will never buy a different spf moisturizer. This one absorbs right into my skin, doesn't contribute to the oiliness, doesn't cause breakouts, and does not have a scent! The price of one bottle is reasonable since it lasts 5 months with daily use. I cannot recommend this product strongly enough if you are prone to oily skin and are trying to prevent the signs of aging."," January 24, 2015"
1506,Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is great because it is not oily and does not make ...,"  I fight acne all the time, despite being mid 30s.

Maybe more awesome than this."," June 7, 2017"

A little dab of this cream goes a long way for overall coverage and it set well under my make up (or without). My skin wasn't overly-shiny or oily, it didn't make me break out (but I can't be sure if it helped to clear my skin either) and it provides excellent SPF safety."," October 7, 2011"

One little pump covers my entire face and neck. My current bottle lasted 4 months. It's well worth the price. And if this gives you any indication of how much I'm in love with this product...I'm about to buy my 4th bottle of it. I'm always searching for something new and better, but NOTHING I try comes close to this."," March 16, 2013"

It is light, non-oily, and fragrance free. It sinks right in your skin when applied, you can easily wear make-up on top if you prefer because it is so light.

1540,Felecia Kay,1.0 out of 5 stars,Odd man out...#fail,"  So I guess I'm the odd man out. This sunscreen did not work for me at all. After one day of using it, it completely messed my skin up. I guess it clogged my pores, because soon after, I had whiteheads on my chin. I've never had whiteheads in my life. Not to mention I noticed some small bumps on my forehead as well. This was the only new product that I'd introduced in my routine so I knew this was the culprit. I've since returned this product, and will be sticking to my Neutrogena ultra sheer liquid sunscreen. I've never had an issue with that. I was just interested in trying something new, since this is supposed to be geared towards oily/acne skin. I guess everything isn't for everyone, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I should've never tried this to begin with."," February 12, 2016"

The product does not contain fragrance and is extremely lightweight, but still moisturizing. I've used lower SPF creams that were extremely greasy. I've finally found the best cleanser to combat my oily, acne prone skin.. and now this moisturizer is the final step in my morning regimen. The price is pretty reasonable due to the bottle size, and the small amount required to moisturize your face. I can finally stop spending hundreds of dollars looking for the perfect product."," December 18, 2011"

I have trusted these products to apply to my 12 year old every day in the summer while going to surf camp, boy scout camp, etc.  I have never gotten a sunburn while wearing these products.  I wear these products everyday in sunny So. California.  There is no smell and I have a hound-dog nose.  I think Elta wants you to purchase there products only from dermatologists in order to keep their prices high and maintain an exclusive image, however, I have never been dissatisfied with the products purchased on Amazon.

The pump is a great feature to let you know how much you should put on for protection.  While it looks like a lot, it doesn't take that long to be absorbed and doesn't leave that ""ghost-like"" effect that some mineral sunscreens do.  The only disadvantage is that I have to put on a separate moisturizer as my skin is quite dry."," May 27, 2013"

1647,Newton,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the greatest skincare products of all time,"  I've become a skincare guru after battling severe acne for over 10 years. While using Retin-A, and later Accutane, I learned about the importance of sunscreen, but never found one I liked. They all had one of these problems: smelled bad, left a greasy film, left a white cast, or were ineffective. A friend introduced me to Elta MD UV Shield, which had none of these problems, and I fell in love.After finishing a round of Accutane, my acne eventually came back in full force. My dermatologist didn't let me go back on Accutane, because she said that I was considered a new acne patient now, and must start from the beginning. i tried every topical product to no avail, and was about to throw in the towel when I discovered that Elta MD had new product out called UV Clear. I fell in love all over again.Instead of various cleansers, moisturizers, toners, serums, creams, etc., my routine has now been reduced to the following: 1. Wash face with plain water. 2. Apply UV Clear.That's it. My skin has been the clearest it has ever been. Oily skin is no longer a problem. I don't have to go back onto Accutane.

I have tried too many branded sunblocks out there (Neutrogena ultra sheer, Aveeno, Cetaphil, Eucerin, Olay with SPF15) and this is hands down the best and lightest sunblock I have ever tried. Next would be Olay then Aveeno but it makes my face oily after a couple of hours. It is creamy-liquid in consistency and never made my face oily or greasy even after 5 hours. For some strange reason, I also notice that it makes my acne blemishes lighter in appearance. It is expensive compared to other brands but I am very satisfied with this product."," October 17, 2012"

Otherwise okay.,"  I am the type of person that HATES the feeling of sunscreen, moisturizer, or any kind of liquid/lotion product on my face and I only started regularly wearing sunscreen about two years ago when I turned 25. I learned about this brand on a Reddit page for acne-prone, sensitive skin, and I've been purchasing it on Amazon ever since. I won't lie, I still don't use it daily but I try to use it on days where I know I'll be outside or in the car a lot. This sunscreen is NOT WATERPROOF or SWEATPROOF which sucks because when I swim or sweat, it drips into my eyes and burns, so in the summer I just use regular waterproof sunblock. The good thing about the Eltamd is that it dries quickly and is pretty sheer, and it comes in a pump bottle so it also mixes well with most liquid makeup. The cons are obviously that it's not waterproof or sweat proof and it burns/stings a lot if it gets in your eyes due to water or sweat."," December 6, 2015"

1723,Emmie A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,An AWESOME product that has it all!,"  This is by far the best facial sunscreen I have ever used, and there have been several.  My dermatologist recommended a product with zinc oxide that offered protection from UVB and UVA rays.  In the past any sunscreen I tried made my face break out or super oily.  This formula has done neither. It has both lactic and  hyaluronic acid which has helped keep my skin clear and reduce shine.  I love that it comes in a pump which keeps the product fresh and clean.  It doesn't leave a white cast either.  It dries completely clear so it doesn't interfere with any makeup I apply.  One tip I would share is to allow time for it to absorb into your skin before applying foundation.  It takes less than 5 minutes.  We recently returned from a week on the beach in Florida and my skin looks great; no burns, freckles or brown spots.  I love it!"," July 18, 2016"

It's very important to me to have full protection, as I had a basal cell carcinoma removed two years ago, and have been strongly cautioned by my dermatologist never to leave the house without sunscreen on. It's very difficult to make a high SPF broad spectrum facial sunscreen, apparently, because I have yet to find one that doesn't have something major wrong with it--they are either too thin and runny, or too thick and white. Elizabeth Arden used to make a great one, with SPF 50, but inexplicably it only screened Utra Violet A rays, and not B. Go figure. Anyway, they discontinued it (why does that always happen? Makers stop making good products-?) so it's moot. I'll keep looking, because Eltamud isn't it."," May 9, 2014"

Overall i like the lotion and i would be tempted to purchase it again but its kind of thick and heavy. I think it clogged my pores too because i started to see some small blemishes on my forehead after using it for a week.It might have been too heavy for winter or something so i plan to give it another shot sometime this summer.," April 30, 2013"
1744,Randy P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Goes on smooth!,"  I live in Florida where you can sunburn on the beach in minutes. Elta was recommended by my dermatologist.

I have tried them all."," July 14, 2014"

1748,get your hands dirty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great alone or under makeup for sensitive and/or oily skin.,"  I have been using this product for 6 months by recommendation from my dermatologist. My face has speckled sun spots (giraffe spotting) and occasional break-outs. I use an additional prescribed product for the acne and the need for a strong protective sunblock is a must.  I prefer the ""tinted"" solution over the ""clear"" of this Elta MD UV Broad Spectrum.  The tint is similar to a medium foundation shade. I don't feel the coverage is heavy.  The solution is creamy and lightweight and rubs in well like a lotion. It will not completely cover my sun spots, but I do feel the overall product blends my multi-shade face well without adding additional makeup. By mid-day, I have minimal sheen. *NOTE when sweating, if you wipe your face you will remove the product and color transfer will be on your towel. It does NOT stain.Recommended for sensitive, oily or sun-spotted faces.(39 yr-old, caucasian-japanese, medium skin shade, tans easily, very oily face, acne prone.)"," October 17, 2016"

1754,MCarter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product - friendly to acne prone skin,"  I have oily, acne prone skin and usually any lotion based product on my face causes acne breakout.

I ordered this product from Amazon after receiving a sample at my dermatologist's office."," December 29, 2012"
1755,Ying,5.0 out of 5 stars,best sunscreen ever,"  I've bought 2 of these sunscreens. I love these so much! I've tried so many different sunscreens and by far, this is the best. This doesn't sting your eyes when you rub them (like other sunscreens do). And this comes in a super convenient bottle that allows you to squeeze out the right amount of lotion. Although the bottle may seem small, it surprisingly lasts a really long time. It also has a really high spf of 46.The texture of the lotion is really light and doesn't feel like it clogs the pores. It actually feels more like a moisturizer than a sunscreen. I typically reapply a few hours after the first application..just to make sure I'm well protected.The only con I can find about this product is when you come to the bottom of the bottle, I feel like there's more product that could be squeezed out, but since the bottle itself cannot be opened, the remainder of the product isn't really accessible. :("," March 21, 2016"

1761,Shari,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality!,"  I like how this sunscreen is really lightweight, I was surprised when I first used it. I didn't give it five stars because I feel like it does make me breakout a bit (not nearly as much as other face sunscreens I've previously used though), but I guess that's expected for all sunscreens.

1775,M. P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found my daily face lotion!,"  I was looking for a daily high-SPF face lotion that was light weight, without parabens, and didn't cause breakouts. This stuff is great!  It is the consistency of a nice facial moisturizer and soaks in well due to the cyclomethicone, I believe. The main sun blocking agent is zinc oxide, so it will leave a chalky residue that is noticeable particularly when applied to a hair line or eyebrows. Because of this, I had to start washing my face at night. All in all, it's one of those things I should do anyway! It doesn't block my pores as much as other microparticulates do. Completely worth every penny (or a $20 and a $10). I would have saved tons of money had I not wasted my time with cheaper products that are sitting in my bathroom practically full."," June 26, 2012"

I've used it on my kid's sensitive skin, too!  Pair this with Elta's tinted physical block and you have water resistant sun coverage and foundation-like coverage.  This is a BB cream BEFORE BB creams became all the rage.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."," August 14, 2013"
1786,H. Yang,2.0 out of 5 stars,It gave me cystic acne,"  I really want to like this product. At first, I felt like everything was great but after a month of using this, I started getting very painful cystic acne. I tend to get just one cystic acne due to my period but I noticed I was breaking out even long after my period was over. This has to be the problem because I haven't added anything else to my routine. I like that it didn't feel too greasy and it smelled soooo good like almonds. But it definitely didn't work with my face. And I felt like my skin became way to dry. It's also hard to wash off. ( my skintype is acne prone/Asian/oily in t-zones)"," October 30, 2013"

I won't even ever bother to try another product after Elta. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist after I went to see him about the sun damage I've started to notice on my face. I wish I had started using this 10 years ago in my early 20s! In the past sunscreen has caused breakouts for me even when I've used higher end brands such as Kate Sommerville spf 50 for face. No breakouts with Elta.  Elta has an amazing, light texture without any of the sticky, pasty pilling I've gotten from other products. I use maybe a half or 3/4 pump and mix it with a few drops of my Make Up Forever HD foundation."," November 16, 2013"
1795,OpinionbyKristen,5.0 out of 5 stars,My go to daily facial sunscreen,"  This is a great high spf facial sun lotion that lasts a long time.

If not rubbed in well, you will have a chalky appearance. The product is white and I'm asian.  This does not go on clear. Also, it's doesn't work well for me on the hot humid days or if I end up sweating. However, not sure that there's a product out there that would work better.  It doesn't cause acne and has a good SPF on it so I will continue using."," September 28, 2014"

I even use it on my 6-year-old and 9-year-old daughters before school. It is completely clear going on so it does not look like they are wearing makeup and it has no odor. I have been using sunscreen daily on my face for a long time. I want to avoid wrinkles and dark spots! The problem for me has been finding a product to use on my sensitive skin. My skin either turns red and burns or breaks out with many products. This is perfect for me, no irritation, no break outs. I highly recommend this fabulous product for daily use."," May 8, 2016"

Bottle doesn't travel well though.","  This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist office, and I can pick it up from amazon for the same price they sell it at the office.  Most sunscreens feel heavy, or leave my face feeling greasy, but this sunscreen is light weight, and I don't feel like i have a mask on my face when I wear it.  I have to deduct a star from my review because I am always on the road for work and the bottle doesn't travel very well.  Even with it in the 'locked' position, sunscreen tends to leak out into the cap.  It's a waste of money and sunscreen-- it's a pretty small and expensive bottle.  I will continue to purchase it despite the traveling issue because it feels the best on my face of all the sunscreens I've tried!"," November 13, 2014"

It was traumatic, I had to turn down work that involved being outside, had to change my wardrobe to include clothes that completely covered me even if I was only going to be near a window for a little while.  I totally changed my lifestyle all the while working with my dermatologist trying to find out what was behind the problem.  I am not saying the lotion caused the sensitivity.

I ordered this one because it came packaged with 2 bottles of Clear. However, that isn't what was shipped to me. I received one bottle of Clear and one bottle of Daily. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I had already thrown the boxes away and started using the bottles interchangeably.

I use it after moisturizing and under my makeup. I only buy cruelty-free products, and I'm glad that Elta MD is cruelty-free because their sunscreen rocks. One bottle lasts me about 6-8 months with daily use on my face. My only complaint is that you can't really open up the bottle- so when you're down to the last few drops you can't really reach inside and scrape out the last bit.With all these solicited reviews floating out there now, I want to add that this review is unsolicited and honest.

Even though this sunscreen is more expensive than I'd like, it doesn't break me out nor does it make my skin more oily, which makes it worth the price. The niacinamide combined with the daily UV protection has also helped my some of my stubborn PIH fade over time. I'd recommend this to anyone who has had issues with finding a sunscreen that won't aggravate acne-prone skin."," September 16, 2014"

1914,Kimberly M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Drying, white cast, chemical smell, but nice pump dispenser","  I bought this on Amazon in 2013 and used it, along with one other ss, going back and forth to evaluate and compare the two. I have re-ordered the other but not this one. I don't like this sunscreen because it makes my skin feel dry (and I have really oily skin), and leaves a white cast if I use the amount needed to get the sun protection touted. There is also a weird smell--very chemically--that I dislike. I can handle strong scents, but this one isn't right. There are  too many chemical ingredients to feel comfortable using this on my face daily. I really do like keys moisturizer with 30+ spf; it has 20% zinc and only a handful of natural ingredients--and it doesn't leave my oily skin feeling dry and tight. I do like the air pump dispenser."," March 7, 2015"

Packaging, feel, viscosity, look on skin, same NO redness of skin after being outdoors for a while.

This stuff is amazing! Having a 2-in-1 moisturizer/sunscreen can actually dry out your skin when used twice a day (which I found out after and noticed a huge difference).

I like pump-type products but I prefer when there is also a screw-off cap.  I despise when companies do not give you that option.  They force  you to repurchase earlier than necessary when, many types, there's still plenty of product in the bottom of the bottle.

2181,Susan S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Alone. Problematic Under Make-Up.,"  So this product is great on bare morning skin. It absorbs fast, dries clear (so long as you rub it in!) and doesn't have that horrible sunscreeny film--an impressive feat for such a high SPF product. Since I live in Texas and often work outside, having a great sunblock integrated into my daily care is a necessity, and this one is certainly worth the price for the protection and feel. However, I have to wait longer than what works in my morning routine to put it on under my Origins Plantscription foundation. If I give it less than 10 minutes, the suncreen balls up and rubs off with very, very little friction. In the battle for most important product, the UV Clear wins so I'll be looking for a foundation that works better on top. Kind of a bummer for what everyone has called such a low fuss product."," April 8, 2014"

Despite its price, I keep at least a couple around to make sure I don't run out.The only thing, though, this Eltamd sunscreen doesn't claim water resistant.

2230,santababy<3,4.0 out of 5 stars,Light and white! Good for acne prone skin.,"  Of all the sunscreen lotions that I have tried, this is by far the lightest formula. It goes on white and leaves a little tint but doesn't look bad at all. I break out very easily and using this has not caused any crazy major breakouts so 5 stars for that. Just plain sun exposure makes me break out but after using this, I have noticed I can be out in the summer sun without any major breakouts. And it of course helps with the sun burn. I have been very diligent with it so I have noticed that it helps with keeping my skin complexion from getting darker. I am Indian and would prefer to be fair and this definitely helps ;)I can't rate it 4.5 stars so I have to give this 4 stars because it has a strong smell which I am guessing is the zinc. People around me are able to smell it hours after I put it on. So for those that are sensitive to strong chemical-like smells, or have family and friends that are sensitive to the smell, you probably won't like this.But if you suffer from acne and are looking for sunscreen that won't make you breakout but has great coverage with lots of protection from the sun, you should give this a try. If you can get past the smell, then you will like this for sure!!!"," April 18, 2013"

It's kind of expensive for the size, but well worth it. I was surprised when my dermatologist didn't carry it in their office. WHAT?? They carried some other product that I wasn't even the least bit inclined to look at.IMHO, this the best sunscreen for my face. Is it for yours? Everyone's skin is different, but give it a shot. It does leave a little shine to your face but not greasy at all. That can be remedied with a little face powder, which I don't use myself at this point.I don't always leave reviews for products, but this product deserves a thumbs up!"," February 25, 2017"

I am a football coach and spend much of August in the sun, and every afternoon all football season, so I get a of sun. I don't know if this is my imagination or not, but this product seems to be cooler on my face. It lets my skin breath. Do not let the price scare you off. It is worth its weight in gold."," November 6, 2014"

They have always been too greasy, too shiny, melted off in the heat, left white residue, or felt heavy- some even burn my face.  The EltaMD UV Clear SPF46 is so light it doesn't feel as though you have anything on your face.  I work in a public school (NO air conditioning) in the Northeast where it is hot and humid during the summer.  Even in my swampy building, the Elta sunscreen held up.  Yes, it costs more than Neutrogena, but it is so much better!  Since Elta does cost about 3x more, I use it for my sunscreen for work, when I need to look a little more presentable.  I'll still use my Neutrogena Free & Clear at the beach (because teachers are not made of money!), but Elta is hands-down my favorite! I have VERY sensitive skin, and this didn't bother it at all.  If you are on the fence, just try it- Amazon has a generous return policy, and you may just find your favorite sunscreen too!"," July 14, 2011"

It's not greasy, makeup applies well over it and it does seem to protect my skin from more damage. I am a certified product junkie and rarely loyal to any brand. However, I have re-purchased this 3 times, a major anomaly for me! Better than Shiseido, Chantecaille, the list goes on and on (I've tried most high end products by now); this still ALWAYS has a place on  my shelf."," October 27, 2014"

2461,Adrienne Doster,1.0 out of 5 stars,... to try this as I had heard nothing but great things about it - online,"  I get occasional acne and have problems with redness/rosacea so I saved up to try this as I had heard nothing but great things about it - online, from reviews, from makeup artists,etc. But this stuff is horrible. It doesn't moisturize the skin at all. After realizing it would not moisturize on its own, I added a layer of my regular moisturizer before putting on the Elta. But it seemed as if the Elta just sucked up all the moisturizer and still left my face tight and really dry to the touch.And like others have mentioned on here, if you use a primer or foundation after this, it will rub off and roll up onto your skin, even with the lightly touch and with any applicator, (fingers, sponge, brush).Sorry to say I won't be repurchasing. You've been warned!"," May 14, 2015"

2487,Lisa K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facial lotion ever!,"  I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. I've tried a lot of products in the past and this is by far the best facial lotion out there. I had a lotion that worked really well called Epionce, however it didn't have any sun protectent. I used sunscreen on top of using that product but would break out due to the sunscreen. Elta is lightweight, seemingly fragrance free and doesn't make you break out. I haven't noticed any reduction in rosacea, as I am a pale blonde gal. But the redness doesn't really bother me. I've recommended this to so many of my friends that suffer with acne or sensitive skin. I lather this on every morning. I don't wear foundation so I am not sure how they coordinate with eachother but the lotion absorbs relatively quickly. The best candidates for this product is oily, sensitive and acne prone skin. If your looking for super moister cream, this is not for you. Although this topical is pretty expensive, but it is totally worth it."," October 27, 2014"

I've been wearing this exclusively for about a week and my skin is left feeling super dry, like to the point where it's uncomfortable, as though I'd rubbed six layers of alcohol over it. And my acne is still as bad as it was, not that I was really expecting this to clear it (just not make it worse). I hoped this would work as my one-stop moisturizer w/ SPF that wouldn't clog up my pores or leave my face greasy like so many SPF products do, but I'll either have to wear it over another moisturizer or keep looking."," October 19, 2015"

I'm also prone to breakouts, so decided to spend the big bucks on this dermatologist recommended product. I love it because it doesn't feel oily, doesn't cause breakouts, and doesn't leave white residue on my face. I use it religiously every morning (in combo with a chemical sunscreen I put on first). I still get some blotchy skin-darkening due to the Melasma, but I believe that would be the case no matter how much sunscreen I put on."," October 28, 2014"

2601,Elizabeth Mitchell,5.0 out of 5 stars,sunscreen,"  I have to wear sunscreen all the time, so I've tried out a few different brands for sensitive skin. This is my favorite so far, because it doesn't feel greasy when it goes on, it's clear when it goes on, doesn't make you to shiny, and there's no weird residues. You can put your make up on over it, no problem. The only issue I have with it is that, like it says on the bottle, you really do have to re-apply after exercise or sweating. It is not waterproof at all. So when I'm hiking or going to the beach, I definitely use a stronger brand. But for just day to day use, I think the Eltamd SPF 46 is the best sunscreen (I've come across, at least)."," February 3, 2013"

I have incredibly oily skin, and this sunscreen sat well without making me oilier. It has an incredibly lightweight texture and a smooth, soothing application. I am also impressed by the niacinamide in it. However, there is one huge hangup for me: it pills like CRAZY. I can't even touch my face after application without white balls coming off of my face, and this happens regardless if I wear makeup on top. Makeup application is a nightmare.

It does not feels like a sunblock is more like a moisturizer2. With just one pump you get to cover your face and neck3. It feels so light in your face that you can apply you makeup afterwards4. It's also clear color, so you don't look like a ghost after applying it, so that's another plus for me.When it arrived I was scared it was not going to last long since the bottle seemed very small (is the size of liquid foundation). I got the 1.7oz, but since you get to distribute it in all your face and neck with one pump I think it might be ok... but I'll update my review and see after daily use how long it will last.

I actually have dry skin but this product has niacinimide which acts as a moisture barrier for all skin types. I still where a lightweight moisturizer along with it sometimes but it's only when I'm not applying a moisturizing bb creme or Chanel vitalumiere..if I'm wearing any makeup with moisture (always I use light makeup) elta md clear for acne problem skin never dries me out. Another bonus is that if I'm in a rush and I can only wash my face..I sometimes only apply this and nothing more. It really leaves my skin luminescent...and I'm sure it's because of the niacinimide. Just so you can imagine how good this is...it's as good as Sunday Riley cashmere sunscreen (150.00) and I'm not giving elta the advantage because of the cost difference it's as good on its own. The other sunscreen I used which is great as good as elta is cle de Peu SPF 50. The more expensive ones still don't offer the chemical engineering of adding ingredients that sustain moisture levels and keep our skin clear.

In fact this is our family favourite. It's fragrance free , oil free,paraben free. That's what attracted me to buy this product first time. I have sensitive acne prone skin. So I was researching for a good sunscreen that wouldn't trigger any break outs. In the past I have had very bad outcomes with various other sunscreens that I ve tried.But after trying this product I was really happy with the result. It absorbs quickly. Just a single pump gives good coverage to the face. It's not oily and leaves no color or residue when applied. I wear this under make up. Never gave me any breakouts.

3914,Jane Eyre,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best physical SPF for any skin type,"  This is the best sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have been trying sunscreens for 15+ years at drugstores, Sephora, the department store, etc. EltaMD sunscreens will not cause breakouts, and this formulation (UV Clear) is incredibly fast absorbing and light. I have sensitive skin that does not respond well to chemical sunscreens such as avobenzone, and my facialist applied EltaMD (the post-facial formulation, which has more emollience) after a microdermabrasion treatment. She told me this product's zinc oxide not only effectively blocks sunscreen, but also has calming properties on skin and an optical brightening effect due to the micronized zinc oxide particles.Ever since that day I have been using the EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 on a daily basis because this an exceptional formulation. In addition it is priced competitively: you can't be too precious about sunscreen because its efficacy depends on consistent, daily use: slather it on every morning, regardless of sun or rain (because UV rays penetrate office windows, car windows, clouds, etc.). With this product and its attractive price point, I can afford to use it generously everyday without feeling as though I need to be delicate about application.Best of all, it doesn't rely on drying ingredients to impart a ""dry touch"" feel like a certain popular drugstore brand. EltaMD's sunscreens, in particular the UV Clear formula, sinks in immediately. I wear it under makeup and there has never been any pilling, white reflection, or other problems. It doubles as an excellent primer for foundation.I've been buying this in bulk for 3+ years now, and I can't imagine ever using another facial sunscreen unless there is a revolution in the sunscreen market."," August 25, 2013"

I have been using this on a daily basis for three weeks now with no side-effects, which is a first for me.Here is a partial list of products that I have tried for facial sun-protection: Skinceuticals - 2 formulations, Neutrogena, Lavera - 1 for face, 1 for children, Aveeno, Mustela - baby stick style. I had to stop using each of the aforementioned products because they either caused extreme irritation and/or made my face breakout. Because, I was determined to find a product to use on my face, if I only broke out (without burning, redness or peeling)I would try it a few more times to make sure the acne was a result of the product. Also, To be fair, Aveeno and Mustela were ones that I tried several years ago and I see that they have new products on the market now.I chose Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 based on customer reviews and I am extremely grateful to those who took the time to review this product."," April 14, 2012"

Many SPF's feel heavy on the face and take forever to rub in, and seem to stay ""white"" on your face for a while.  The Elta MD product is much finer than other SPF products, and therefore does not give your face that whitish tint.  It rubs in quickly and does not feel greasy later!  I am often outdoors in the Phoenix sun/heat for my job.  Lasts all day, wears extremely well under makeup or alone and will not make you shiny!!  It is truly a GREAT product!"," August 20, 2012"

It is so matte & oil-absorbing and really does seem to blur imperfections so that makeup is not necessary.  It was a dream to wear for about three days.  On the third day, I noticed things taking a turn for the way worse.  Basically, this caused me to break out into cystic acne in my oilier regions and caused really red, flaky rashes in my dry patches.  I looked like I had eczema.  Something in this sunscreen just did not sit well with my dry combination sensitive skin.  Also, this pilled like crazy, so I was actually UNABLE to apply makeup over it (which was fine/preferable for me, as I like to go au naturale anyway).  Since this moisturizer is basically the highest rated sunscreen on the market, I'm sort of at a loss now...  I would love recommendations."," January 24, 2013"

It broke me out in what I call ""irritation acne"", not exactly painful cysts but rather millions of pore-sized nodes.I am pretty sure what caused the irritation for me was either the finely ground zinc or the high niacinamide content.

However, like many of the writers of most of the other more negative reviews, I too experienced a really awful reaction to this. I started using it while on vacation, and within a couple of days my face and neck were blanketed with a terrible rash. My skin is covered in tiny bumps, and is reddish and painful. I continued to use EltaMD for a few more days after the reaction started as I chalked my skin's strange flare up to the transition to a very warm humid climate (due to the product's description, I really thought it couldn't be the Eltamd that was causing it).Unfortunately, by the time I stopped using it (after 5 daily applications), even my most basic and gentle skin care products stung pretty badly. It's now a couple of days later and my skin is still a mess. Needless to say, I will not be continuing to use it. I'm disappointed that it didn't work for me, it really seemed like the perfect product in my search for a non-chalky, non-comedogenic, fragrance-free facial sunscreen. If you do try it, just be really attentive to how your skin responds within the few days or so and discontinue use ASAP if you experience irritation."," April 4, 2015"

4619,Kristen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great choice if you have acne scars!,"  This is the fist sunscreen I've tried that I'm willing to wear everyday. For reference, I'm 22 years old, Caucasian, acne-prone, with somewhat oily skin. My main skincare goals are preventing sun damage, preventing acne, and getting rid of my acne-scars (or post-inflamatory hyperpigmentation).I absolutely love this sunscreen! Most importantly, it has good broad spectrum protection (SPF 46 and PPD rating of 16.37, or PA+++). I had to e-mail the company to find out the PPD rating.Secondly, it is the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I've tried. When it goes on, there is a white cast that is only visible for a few seconds, it quickly fades (although I'm pretty pale, so your milage may vary if you have darker skin). At first, the finish is somewhat greasy but if you let it absorb into your skin for 10-20 minutes, the greasiness subsides. It also looks good under my matte mineral powder foundation. After applying this sunscreen and my foundation I end up with a mostly matte but slightly dewey finish. I like it. It also doesn't make my skin get super greasy over the course of the day. It has not given me any pimples. It's moisturizing, but not super moisturizing.Now I'm getting to the best part - this product has niacinamide. If you don't know what niacinamide is, google it. It's the most magical ingredient. (BTW this is the reason that this sunscreen is slightly more expensive than the other EltaMD sunscreens). More sunscreen companies should make sunscreens with niacinamide! It makes perfect sense, because this is a product that helps fade acne scars. The sun makes acne scars much worse/darker. SO with this sunscreen you are (1) preventing your scars from getting worse and (2) actively fading them! I've seen visible results in only 2 weeks on scars that I've had for YEARS! I have before & after pictures to prove it, and would post them here if I could.TL;DR: If you want to protect your skin from the sun and fade acne scars at the same time, this is the product for you. It is well worth the money. If you don't have any acne scars, I'd probably save a little cash and look into EltaMD UV Physical."," August 16, 2014"

Unfortunately, when I received the bottle, it came in a flimsy manila envelope lined with bubble wrap.  The box was damaged, and somehow, a good amount of the sunscreen had spilled out into the cap (which was still firmly attached).  (How could that have happened while the envelope was sealed?????)I'm extremely disappointed that I paid full price for a product that couldn't even arrive inside its packaging.  This sunscreen is not cheap.  I was looking forward to ordering the other Elta products from this seller (BeautyandFragrance) but their shoddy care for shipping their products leads me to think that they'd rather have me shop elsewhere.

I changed my cleanser, toner, moisturizer, exfoliant, serum, etc. NOTHING CHANGED. Then I said let me try to change this product that is SUPPOSEDLY so amazing. Lets see if this is causing the red bumps and the irritated skin! Within 2 days I cleared up about 60%. After a week, I was 90% better. This dumb product is the worst. I dont even know why I tried it.Its silky but it leaves a NOTICEABLE shine on your face. I already have oily skin, I don't need extra shine! Also, my skin felt like it was suffocating, as if the sunscreen were like a plastic bag draining air out of my pores. Im not even being dramatic because the feel of this sunscreen was horrid on my skin. I dont know why I put up with it. I thought it had to be good because everyone ravess about this. Well people on makeupalley.com had the same problem as me, and this product is not recommended my oily, acne-prone people.

4675,Learning_As_I_Go,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sun protection = less hassle. Finally.,"  I hate sunscreen. I hate going to the beach and slathering it on and sweating and coming back at the end of the day with an oily, mildly broken out face that takes forever to clear back up (mostly because I have to keep putting it on if I go back out to beach/pool/whatever).That said, I have been trying to jump on the bandwagon of people who acknowledge that as annoying as it is, sunscreen is necessary if I want to protect my skin and prevent a lot of the issues I'd be paying for later otherwise. So I've tried several. I've done the regular face sunscreens from the drugstore - there are some that are okay but still leave me oily later in the day (combination skin) and prone to milia. I've tried numerous BB creams/tinted moisturizers with SPF, but the ones with higher SPF (25+ which is what I'd prefer for my face if I'm going to bother with this) don't typically have a texture or staying power that I really like. And I don't want to pile on makeup. Soooo....I read a lot of reviews and found this. I've been using it for about 3 weeks. Every. Day. It really is very light, absorbs very quickly and I have had NO break-out issues with it. No oiliness. It's actually quite good as a light moisturizer under whatever foundation or makeup I want to wear. When it was colder, I would still layer it with another moisturizer, but for the summer I will skip that step entirely and stick with the sunscreen.So in summary:I am mid-twenties, combination skin with mild hormone-related acne, light/medium skin.Product does not cause oiliness (even t-zone mid-day)No breakoutsWorks as light moisturizerNo white cast, absorbs quickly and fullyMy skin likes it and I highly recommend."," May 6, 2013"

It was determined that EltaMD is actually less than SPF 30 (They weren't the only brand, I suggest looking up the full article). I had also given a bottle to my mom, who burns much easier than I do. When I told her about this article, she remarked that she thought she was burning too easily when she used it (compared to what she used previously), but she wasn't sure if she was imagining it or not.

4680,Jon K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sunscreen.  Light, high SPF, not oily, & niacinamide.","  My favorite sunscreen that I have found so far.  It goes on clear, is light, high SPF, not oily, and it has niacinamide to help fade PIH.  It is a slightly more expensive for the amount you get, but it does work wonderfully.  It's a great physical sunscreen with Zinc Oxide vs the chemical options out there.  If you believe all sunscreens are equal you might want to check out the differences between physical and chemical sunscreens.  If you have a bad reaction to one it is worth trying the other type of sunscreen.  A downside that recently came up is that the dispenser has changed.  Before it used to work beautifully and a single pump would be enough to cover my entire face due to the air tightness of the bottle.  The new dispenser design allows air to get inside causing multiple pumps in order to get a proper portion.  But even with the flaw I still have to say it's one of the best sunscreens I have come across, I'd just wish they would revert back to the older dispenser design."," January 28, 2016"

This has got to be one of the most hyped sunscreen creams in existence. It is listed everywhere as the holy grail sunscreen.

4688,Daniel Lin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Contains Octinoxate,"  I've been using this sunscreen for more than 3 years. However, I just found out that this sunscreen contains an active ingredient called Octinoxate. I had to goggle what it is and this is what i found:""EWG recommends that consumers avoid sunscreens with oxybenzone. Octinoxate is an organic UV filter. It is readily absorbed into the skin and continues to be absorbed after the sunscreen has been applied. It has been found in blood 16 times above the proposed FDA safety threshold (Matta 2019, 2020).""Its also bad for the ocean and environment - Hwaii has banned this ingredient in their sunscreen products.

4689,Sara  S'Jegers,1.0 out of 5 stars,This sunscreen is harmful to your health -- Do not buy...,"  This product has octinoxate in it, an active ingredient that is known to mess with your hormones, and also those of animals, once it ends up in the ocean. On a hormonal level, it mimics estrogen and will mess with your thyroid, and is suspected to accumulate in people. It is harmful to you and to the environment and you really should not be applying this daily!In fact, some places, including the entire state of Hawaii, now have a ban on octinoxate (as well as oxybenzone) in sunscreen products because they had started to destroy the reefs. Just Google 'octinoxate' or 'Hawaii sunscreen ban' to find out more.A safe sunscreen for you and the environment is biodegradable, and ONLY has zinc or zinc and titanium as 'active ingredients' listed on the label. These naturally occurring minerals sit on top of your skin and aren’t absorbed into your bloodstream. When you swim in the ocean, these minerals simply fall back to the Earth from which they came.There are biodegradable sunscreens that DO NOT make your skin look white, and that can be applied on your face daily. It is quite sad that the Skin Cancer Foundation would recommend a product with a hormone disruptor in it. Sure, octinoxate has not been found to cause skin cancer, but it will mess with your health in other ways!! Maybe EltaMd is funding the Skin Cancer Foundation's cancer research?"," November 2, 2018"
4690,Saliandra,2.0 out of 5 stars,Face too shiny. Makeup doesn't look good on top.,"  I had high hopes for this sunscreen, but I have been sorely disappointed with it. It protects well and it feels nice and moisturizing on the skin. However; it is just too shiny. If I put on moisturizer and then this sunscreen, my face is ridiculously shiny. Makeup doesn't look good over the top. The shine comes through, pores look really obvious, and my makes slides right off. If I skip the moisturizer, the effect is slightly better. But it's still too shiny and still looks bad with makeup. I don't understand the great reviews on this. It must just be a reaction with my particular skin. I'm using a normal 1/4 tsp amount of the product. I would say I have combo skin, with a little oiliness in the T-area but dry elsewhere. I would not repurchase this sunscreen."," January 25, 2022"

I was so excited to use it on my face bc it was so light and it was so raved about. well after i used it the next day i was washing my face and my face felt all bumpy and i was breaking out all over my cheeks (mind you i never break out or have any sort of texturized bumps on my skin). I didn't want to believe that it was this product that had given me bumps and broken me out, but i tested it just to make sure before i put it on my face again. i put the lotion on a portion of my wrist and as you can see in the pictures i got the same reaction red little bumps all over my wrist, and not on the middle of my arm where i didn't apply the lotion. (it looks much worse in person the camera didn't capture it well.) If you are looking for something to calm redness or just a good face sunscreen i would not recommend this product.

No government agency oversees this, so skincare companies can claim their products promote clear skin and still have pore-cloggers in their products.

4693,Judith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sunscreen,"  Two pumps is enough to cover your face and neck front.  It spreads easily, but I’ve found it best to dot it around the face and neck, rub the rest into my palms, then disperse over the face and neck. If kept away from the lash line, it protects that delicate skin, too.  Not shiny, like so many others.  However, although I’m very light skinned, I add a couple of drops of Exuviance Sheer SPF 50 on top so it matches my skin tone better.  Rarely use foundation with this combination.  Another plus is that Elta MD dries quickly and isn’t tacky.  I’ve also used the tinted version of this sunscreen, which also works beautifully, though it may pill in more textured areas, like around the nose.  The last advice I can offer is, if you use moisturizer under this (and you should), make sure that the moisturizer is dry before applying the sunscreen. Highly recommended."," April 19, 2019"
4694,RealCity,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dermatologist recommended this.  Love it.,"  I'm a mid-50s gal who no longer wants to spend time fussing over the aging face. I mean, I'm clearly not in my 20s anymore.  But the old face isn't a complete disaster. Yet. That said, there are crow's feet and lip lines and smile lines and whatnot. So, yeah. Aging is happening. This sunscreen, however, is like a little secret weapon.  It provides sunscreen. Obviously.  A  little bit of color makes you look not dead which is a huge plus. But my favorite part is the dewy, glowy finish. I use this sunscreen on my face and an SPF chapstick and I don't know what it is.  Ya girl just looks a little fresher.  A little younger.  A little .... better.  Was worth the money for me. Would recommend. Good luck, ladies."," March 1, 2022"
4695,James D. White,1.0 out of 5 stars,Warning- Spray Version Failed UVA Test,"  Consumer Reports did not test this lotion but they tested the similar spray and it was the worst performing sunscreen of all with  a score of 27. Trader Joe's Spray for $6 scored 100. If you want a fancy lotion, La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Melt-in Sunscreen Milk got the highest score of 100 for a lotion. The combination of zinc oxide and octinoxate may sound scientific but I would wait for independent testing of the lotion before considering this when the spray with the same active ingredients failed so miserably.  Just because lay people like the product, they have no idea how much protection they are  actually getting and skin cancer takes a long time to develop before you realize how screwed you are. Never rely on ordinary people to evaluate sunscreens, it is totally meaningless because they can't establish the long term impact of an inferior product.  The claims of dermatologist recommended if you notice they provide no names of actual dermatologists. I consider this product a scam."," June 16, 2019"

I was a professional model and this was suggested by my dermatologist. never looked back works great no breakouts no irritation and protects your skin! Elta’s ‘shield version also great for oily skin. Just doesn’t have the niacinamide which the clear does.

4697,Zuzana,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth money in my opinion,"  I have actually bought this from the Dermstore not Amazon after seeing all the raves and recommendations for this product on the internet. I am shocked by how badly this stings around the eyes, not mentioning the piling that occurs when trying to layer it (had the same problem with Cerave AM). The main selling point to me was an inclusion of zinc and niacinamide since I have acne prone skin, plus of course the added benefit of potency mineral sunscreen. Will continue to use Japanese sunscreens that are far superior when it comes to comfort and wearability. It does not leave a cast so the ""clear"" claim holds at least."," February 10, 2019"
4698,Adelie,4.0 out of 5 stars,Two different products?,"  It's hard to evaluate a product that's supposed to prevent something from happening, because you can't know what would have happened if you hadn't used it.I've used EltaMD sunscreens for many years and like them for several reasons.  I also dislike this one for an important reason.  Details below.BTW, I only buy things like this from my dermatologist.  He sells the real thing.  Too many reviews complain of counterfeit product, and while it's more expensive to buy it in person, it's worth it.PROS- I like the SPF 50.  Not a very common strength, unless you want the mass-market heavily fragranced stuff.- I love that it's unfragranced.  No smell at all.- Physical barriers work best but aren't as popular as the chemical ones because they show and can be harder to apply.  This one has zinc oxide.CONS- because of the zinc oxide, this goes on whitish and takes a bit of work to disappear.- It's a little thicker and stiffer than others, so it takes some rubbing for it to absorb and become invisible.  Rubbing is the one thing you DON'T want to do to your skin.For some strange reason, the product that comes out of the pump is thicker and harder to apply evenly than the stuff that comes out of the tube.  I prefer the tube - it's lighter and easier to apply.Overall, I like this product and will continue to use it.  But I'll buy it in the tube in the future."," December 13, 2017"

After a half hour walk, my face started to tingle and get red and I came home. It was early morning and winter so sun wasn't strong. I think there is something different in this one but I'm not sure what. I wont use it again but will continue to use the elta md tinted. I'm sorry I paid so much for it and can't use it but that scare was enough. It has been a few hours and is calming down but I wouldn't try it twice."," February 23, 2020"
4700,Shan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not special,"  I bought this spf because I have dehydrated, oily, acne prone skin. I wanted a MINERAL spf that wasn’t going to irritate my acne and maybe even help it as well as not leaving a white cast because I am light skinned black. This spf did nothing for moisture, although I know it’s not technically supposed to, but it actually made my face feel dry and tight. It did nothing for my acne or hyperpigmentation. It has a terrible smell that I can’t even explain but it’s annoying because I could smell it coming off of my face literally all day long. It didn’t leave a horrible white cast after the first application but my face still looked a little ghostly and I didn’t dare reapply every 2 hours as I SHOULD because the cast only got worse. I really wanted a mineral spf to work but I just don’t think I’m going to find one that won’t give me a white cast and I refuse to spend a lot of money on one that I can’t even reapply, which is the whole point of even using it, without looking like Spongebob with the Suds."," October 11, 2019"
4701,Ryan S,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to love this product because it's a physical SPF moisturizer with ...,"  First off, I originally got this product from a dermatologist so I am quite certain I did not get a fake.I wanted to love this product because it's a physical SPF moisturizer with niacinamide and vitamin E and it has an nice texture, but it just wasn't moisturizing enough for me. I use Differin at night which means that my skin needs more moisture and I really noticed my skin being drier and having flakes at the end of the day after switching from CeraVe's AM moisturizing lotion. This product does have a really great texture, but when I went on vacation to a drier climate, it tended to leave white powder on my face when it dried up later in the day. It can also leave white powder on your face if you put too much, like I tried to do because the product wasn't moisturizing enough for me.I will be sticking with CeraVe AM moisturizing lotion SPF 30 because it's a lot more hydrating and occlusive for my skin while still providing physical SPF and niacinamide (but no antioxidants). It's also a lot cheaper, which means that you will feel less guilty about using more and you will actually get the full amount of sun protection on the label. This is still a great product and will probably work well for people who are not using retinoids or do not have dry skin.[2019 update]Since I originally wrote this review I have tried this again. I rarely get acne anymore but if I use this sunscreen for just 3-4 days then my face will start to feel extremely tight and I will get huge painful cystic acne within a week. I know because it just happened. Also it seems like any kind of sunscreen that ends up pilling somehow compromises my moisture barrier and causes cystic acne for me, and this sunscreen very reliably pills (along with the new formulation of CeraVe AM after 2015). I now use La Roche Posay Anthelios SX and Mamonde Everyday Aqua Sun Cream, both of which I find to be very moisturizing and they have newer more innovative sunscreen ingredients than most of the products on the American market."," May 21, 2017"

I used Claritin D to decrease the intense itching & hives which helped. Zinc oxide isn't the likely culprit but more likely the Octinoxate 7.5 mg that's responsible. 24 hours later, the itching & rash is still there.

4704,Sara,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen for acne prone skin,  I was going through a rough time with my skin was finding a routine and I came across this product on Tik Tok through a dermatologist.The purpose of this product is to protect the skin from the sun’s UV rays and helps those with acne-prone skin.Some of the main strengths of this product are it provides protection from the sun. Another strength would be the ingredients such as Niacinamide and certain ceramides that allow those with acne-prone skin to be able to wear sunscreen without having to worry about it clogging their pores.Some main weaknesses would be that it is only available online so when you run out you can’t go to the store and grab another one.Another main weakness would be it is a little pricey but not bad.One of the main weaknesses would be it does leave a bit of a white cast if not worked into the skin properly.Overall I give this product an A because I really like the product. It protects my skin from the sun without it congesting my pores. The white cast isn’t too much of a struggle I just have to work it into my skin a little more.," April 26, 2021"

Perfect if you have oily/combination skin, works well under makeup and barely leaves any white cast. This is moisturizing enough that I don’t need to use one in the mornings (I fo straight from Vitamin C to sunscreen and the makeup). The formula contains Niacinamide, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid, providing additional benefits besides UVA/UVB sun protection. People with dry skin have reported the formula to be too drying, so it might be best for people with oily/combination skin."," November 26, 2021"

It doesn't feel heavy or greasy and it protects my skin pretty well for hours before I have to reapply.  I can even rub it straight onto my eyelids then sweat later or rub my eyes and it doesn't sting.  And since it's not greasy or goopy I am not hesitant to get it well into my ears, which is one of the places many people neglect and thus get skin cancers.

My old go-to was blue lizard but I noticed it was starting to really clog my pores.  I was leaving every surf sesh with a new pimple, how unfortunate.Purchased EltaMD from my DERM today, applied it all over my face for my 1 pm surf sesh and I’m not burnt at all!  Which is a surprise since this isn’t waterproof.  Also, my pores are squeaky clean.  Pretty easy to wash off with a good cleanser.  Whenever I used any other sunscreens (blue lizard, coola, sunbum, Neutrogena, shishedo to name a few) my face always feels very dry after I get out of the water and I need to apply lotion immediately.  But not this time after using EltaMD!  Face felt very moisturized the whole time.  It’s a little expensive but the quality has made me want to purchase their waterproof version as well for my longer surf sessions.If youre looking for a lightweight sunscreen that won’t cause acne this is definitely it (plus dries so nicely AND works as a greater primer for foundation)"," May 27, 2020"

However, after reading the reviews on Amazon I thought maybe my problem was using a different brand as a face wash and moisturizer. Therefore, I ordered the elta MD foaming gel, moisturizer and sunscreen directly from their site but once again it has burned my entire face and neck.

No signs of acne!It also wears AMAZINGLY well under foundation. It's better than some super high-end primers to be honest. I accidentally left this at my cousin's house when I visited for Thanksgiving. I bought another one. Sure it's not cheap, but it's so worth it.

Then I noticed small pimples here and there. I wondered what was clogging my pores. I examined all my other skincare and it was fine. Until Elta. The second ingredient in this: petroleum. Yep, good old greasy Vaseline. I'm really disappointed in Elta. Without realizing it I've been wearing a product that won't let my skin breathe. Back to the drawing board."," January 30, 2019"

Definitely seems to last the proper time in terms of sun protection.6. The texture of this is light, so doesn't feel or look greasy.I have tried many, many sunscreens at all price points.

For me, I’ve had no bad side effects with this product. I use sunscreen twice today; in the morning and in the afternoon when I leave work. There really is nothing bad for me to say about the sunscreen but I did deduct one star because there is not enough product for the price. I ran out of this sunscreen in a month or less.

The pump is also depressing because sometimes I will accidentally pump too much and a whole bunch of product will squirt on my hands and I’m forced to use more than I wanted.  But other than the sad size and poorly constructed pumping dispenser it has an amazing formula. When I first applied it I didn’t feel any stinging on my face and it dried to a nice matte finish. Throughout the whole day my face didn’t even feel greasy and it kept the oiliness at bay which is great because I usually have oily dehydrated skin. I can’t wait to see the effects it has on my acne prone skin with hyperpigmentation as it includes niacinamide and lactic acid both proven to help fade marks.

Elta MD UV Clear takes simplifies my morning routine with strong, broad-spectrum UV protection with stated 5% niacinamide.

4734,RCM,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this stuff,"  I love this stuff! I saw it on some morning show and thought I'd give it a try. I was looking for something with SPF that isn't gross white on your face, doesn't cause acne, and feels light but moisturizes. It ticks all those boxes. I've bought it 3x now. The 2nd package didn't seem to last as long as the first, but maybe I was just imagining that. I'll found out with the 3rd one, which I will be opening soon. Either way it's great for the price; I like to save over the department store versions I've bought in the past. They're also great, but 4X the price."," February 1, 2016"

Too many people have had bad results with it (look at all of the negative reviews).I spoke with the company about the product and they denied it was the product that caused my rash. However, they did offer to replace it with body lotion.Would strongly deter you from trying this product!"," September 22, 2014"

My only complaint is that it irritated my skin just a little bit on my chin, an area that's pretty sensitive for me, but still worth noting since I don't get that with other drugstore sunscreens. I have a hard time justifying this price considering it's not a very big bottle."," April 3, 2018"

After numerous search, I decided to try this one with big hope. However, as soon as I put it on my face, there was burning sensation. Still, I kept it on to see if it was okay. After the whole day with this on, my rosacea got way worse! Stay away from this in case you have rosacea!! You won't be happy about it."," March 10, 2018"
4739,Nancy Ching,3.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PRODUCT!! Not so great price..,"  I have yet to purchase this product, but was able to try it because PA at my dermatologist's office gave me a zillion samples. I was using Obagi's Nuderm spf 50 prior to this and was looking for a less expensive alternative. She told me it was $29 bucks, which is cheaper than the $45 for Obagi. I love, love, love this sunscreen. I like that it was for acne prone skin and supposedly calms it down. My skin isn't exactly irritated or inflamed, I just like how it sounds. It absorbs quickly, no funky sunscreen smell (think Neutrogena). It does NOT leave that white residue on your face. I usually apply my serum, then sunscreen, moisturizer and foundation last.Now on to the price.. The $29 was for 1.7 oz, whereas Obagi is $45 for 3 oz. Those are the prices they charge at the derm office of course, but even online the Obagi is cheaper. So back to Obagi I go. Shame, because I really grew to love this product. I find the products comparable though."," December 17, 2013"

Very disappointing. I have acne and acne scars, just started differin gel so sun protection is a priority. After applying this over every moisturizer I know and own, it balls or pills up leaving me with white fluff all over my face! Not cute when your trying to apply makeup after to cover up acne/scarring! The only good quality is that is does feel nice going on, before it pills. Leaves me wondering if my skin is protected because it's coming off after application. Had potential but unfortunately not for me"," January 21, 2017"

No chemicals, no perfumes, no garbage, just protection. This bottle is small, but this is for face, and it lasted me nearly a year. This is worth it!! I live in Houston, TX, and the dermatologist said that everyone living in a climate like this should basically be using a high SPF sunscreen every day. This goes on smooth and dries quickly. No cons I can think of, except that it's not cheap, but $30 a year? Not too bad, especially for daily use."," May 2, 2016"

4743,Stephanie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen for Oily Skin,"  This sunscreen is the very best for oily, acne prone skin.  I have tried so many sunscreens over the past few years but never stuck with them because they all caused my oily skin to look and feel oiler and all seemed to emphasize my large pores and make them appear even larger.  When I went to a dermatologist for pigmentation issues she told me I MUST use a sunscreen and recommended this one when I told her of my issues.  She said I would LOVE this one and she was absolutely right!  I don't go a day without sunscreen now thanks to this product.  Also, I have found my adult cystic acne has virtually disappeared since using this sunscreen.  I have used proactiv solution and other systems for years and have been treated by a dermatologist for acne, but it has never completely gone away until using this sunscreen. I am very particular about everything I put on my face and I highly recommend this product."," June 8, 2011"

I can't wear before snorkeling or diving because it is slippery and my mask slides around and leaks.  And then it gets in my eyes while diving and I can't get it out.  This product is ok for land if you don't mind a little bit greasy.  I found the Australian Gold mineral based sunscreen is dry and works great while diving and snorkeling.," December 20, 2020"
4748,Gi,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for sensitive skin,"  Works great for sensitive skin, and is nice and light, but  hard to tell if you're getting much protection. I wear it faithfully every time I go out, but am getting sunspots and sun as if I'm not wearing anything. This is on days without sweating. On summer days, it sweats right off. Do you reapply ever few minutes?? If you wear make up over it, that makes it even trickier to reapply often. Using Retin A creams, sunscreen is a must, so this is an issue. Also, it is very pricey."," February 13, 2015"

4755,Trista,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing stuff,"  I received some samples from a dermatology office - put one packet all over my face, arms and legs one day while sitting out in full sun for over 2 hours - I got no color at all!  The best thing is that is glides on well and absorbs well without feeling heavy or chalky as zinc oxide can.  I like the sample packs - there's a surprisingly good amount of product in there and I can easily carry a couple with me all the time.  I would recommend this over Blue Lizard - it is much heavier white cream with lower SPF (30+) coverage.  The Elta is more like makeup consistency and even though I use the tinted, I don't notice any color when it's applied."," July 20, 2016"

The instant I ran out this morning, I walked to the computer and ordered a new bottle.  One bottle lasts quite some time.  This lotion doesn't run into my eyes and burn when I sweat while running.I find that elta md brightens my skin when I apply it, making me look refreshed.  Typically, daily use of elta md will single-handedly keep my skin from drying out.I do have a thyroid condition that occasionally makes my skin doubly dry and tight.  When that happens, a tiny bead of Cera Ve p.m. mixed with elta md whips my moisture balance back into shape.This lotion is also awesome under foundation, for those rare occasions when I wear it."," August 19, 2013"

I have a sensitive skin that breaks out for any reason any time, and every sunscreen I tried caused at least a couple of breakouts around my chin area. This one looks like it's creamy but goes on light and offers a great protection from the sun. When you apply it just allow it a couple of minutes to soak in and then continue with your make up routine. I will never stop using this and I hope they never stop making it."," July 27, 2013"

4761,MD_Girl_in_Texas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen EVER,"  My dermatologist recommended this product because I refused to wear heavy SPF on a daily basis under my make-up.  This product is incredibly light -- it does not have any of the icky, thick, greasy feeling of every other sunscreen out there -- plus it works.

4763,Skin Thera P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight! Smooth! Love it!,"  Since it's summer, the first thing that comes to mind is wearing sunscreen. Being a girl with super oily skin, most of the sunscreens I've used tend to be a bit gunky, too thick of a formula that it ends up leaving a film over my skin and creating even more oil buildup throughout my day (and welcoming some unwanted acne!). Well, not anymore! Since I started working at Skin Thera P Medical Spa in NYC, my eyes have been opened to the beauty that is the UV Clear. This formula is so lightweight, AND it's oil-free! What I love about Elta MD in general is the fact that they have a product for every skin type; it moisturizes the skin as well as protecting it from harsh sun rays. What's also a plus about the Clear is that niacinamide in the formula helps calm and protect sensitive skin, which is a big plus to those who are acne prone. I can definitely see and feel and improvement in my skin, and I love it! I would definitely recommend, and repurchase!"," July 16, 2014"

I am fair complected and a bit of a product junkie-and over the years I have tried a fair amount of products.  What I like about this is that it goes on in a thin layer, doesn't aggravate my skin and although I sweat on a daily basis, it doesn't feel like that typical greasy layer that you get from typical sunscreens.  I use this in conjunction with the SPF 30 body lotion (for chest and arms) in my daily routine and get great results without being greasy.  Makeup applies beautifully over this sunscreen must have. Finally, a sunscreen that doesn't make me feel greasy."," April 13, 2014"
4770,LAShopGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally! An SPF Product worth reviewing...,"  I am an avid online shopper on all the sites and I rely heavily on reviews, yet I never have left one myself until now.  I am in my 30's, fair complexion and somewhat dry-ish skin.  I have been buying SPF products FOR YEARS looking for something I can put on my face that blends easily so I can put make up on afterwards, something that doesn't have fragrance (I'm super sensitive to fragrance) and something that doesn't leave a white, ghostly hue all over my skin or pill up after rubbing.  I have purchased it ALL.  My favorite in the last year or so has been La Roche Posay Extreme Fluid SPF 50, which is very good compared to the millions of other products out there.  But it has a slight fragrance and it does leave a slight white hue on my face and I have to wait forever for it to blend into my skin (and probably wear off) before applying make up, so I often go without it - which is bad for my fair skin and I live in Los Angeles where the sun is hot and always shining.I decided to try yet another SPF product and ordered Elta MD because a few years ago I used an SPF tinted moisturizer from this line that I liked very much until I discovered Laura Mercier's line (which I LOVE). I remembered Elta MD being really nice on the skin, effective and fragrance free. So I ordered this Elta MD Clear SPF and I'M SO GLAD I DID!!!!  It's my favorite!  It isn't greasy, it is indeed CLEAR as you apply it to your face (even though it comes out of the bottle white), it's fragrance free and it blends into my skin like a normal moisturizer.  I hope Elta MD NEVER stops producing this product.  It is everything I have needed.  Somebody FINALLY got it right!  Seriously, buy this because the more people know about it, the longer it stays on the shelves."," June 25, 2012"

Nevertheless, I love it. It goes on smooth and doesn't have a strong smell."," February 7, 2019"

It took me 3 days to realise that it's this sunscreen that have made my rosacea worse.. and not the exposure to sun.

I came across Elta UV Clear SPF46 at my dermatologist's office after a SkinMedica Vitalize peel and LOVED it. It was also the sunscreen of choice at another dermatologist's office after a BBL laser treatment.It is non-greasy, fragrance free and sinks invisibly into the skin.

I have to say I was VERY happy with this sunscreen, it's not heavy or greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and not irritated at all. And seeing I have very sensitive skin thanks to rosacea that is sun light sensitive and prone to breakouts this product is a god send. I no longer break out and my skin is no longer irritated due to my sunscreen and I cannot tell you what a relief that is. I would recommend this to anyone as really it's the best sunscreen around. I was able to not only be out in the sun all day and NOT get a burn but my skin didn't break out or was red and irriated for days after using it either.

4791,breesbazar,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this!,"  I love this sunscreen.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have combination skin, but mainly oily (T zone).  I also have hyperpigmentation, so this is suppose to help with that too.  But mainly it helps my skin not break out, which I care about."," August 28, 2014"
4792,Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this! Will definitely buy it again as soon ...,"  Love this! Will definitely buy it again as soon as  I run out. I've been using this everyday for a little bit over a month and from the feel of the bottle I still have about 50 percent, if not a little more, left.It hasn't broken my face out. I apply this around my eye area and my eyes are fine; no irritation whatsoever. The spf is 46 yet I'm not left with a white caste after applying. This doesn't finish matte but it does leave me with a very nice dewy look, not at all oily.I'd say the only downfall is that initially the pump was super annoying to use. The first couple of times I used this I'd have to pump more than 10 times to get anything out. But within a week it was fine. I don't have an issue with the pump anymore. Everything comes out smoothly.Although the pump was a nuisance I'm still giving this 5 stars. Very much worth the money."," February 20, 2015"

You would not even know you had this on.  Thank goodness I found this!  I actually want to wear it every day, it's so good.  So I get so much more benefit from it.

I was skeptical it would cause more breakouts. I was wrong! In fact, I'm convinced it played a strong part in my skin clearing up. If you have acne prone skin, you're on strong prescription creams, and sunscreen scares you, fear no more! This moisturizer/sunscreen will make you feel smokin hot."," September 26, 2012"
4800,Yt0123,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Absolute Best Facial Sunscreen There Is IMO,"  I decided I wanted to start taking better care of my skin by using sun screen on a regular basis. So, I went on EWG's website to find a recommended facial sunscreen and found this to have a rating of 2 which made me really excited since Amazons reviews were almost all positive. I will say the price has gone up quite a bit since I started purchasing this about 9 months ago, but I just buy it where I can get it the cheapest (about $22 per bottle). There isn't a thing that I don't love about this product. It is paraben free, light weight but very moisturizing, does not leave my skin ashy looking despite having zinc in the ingredients, and comes in the best packaging for a face cream which is a pump style bottle that cannot be opened to allow air inside. My skin is fair and my cheeks burn fairly easily in the sun, but I have never had a problem since using this even on the sunniest days. I really appreciate the high level of niacinamide since I truly believe it's an ingredient which has improved my skin. My cheeks used to be very pink and they have calmed down dramatically in the last 6 months. What I will say is good to know based on my experience is that it may be hard to tell when you're running low because the bottle is already light weight, so after about 6 weeks of daily use, it would be about time for another bottle. Also, I have not had any allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in this cream but some other people have said they have. Unfortunately I can't comment on that since it hasn't happened to me. Overall, this sunscreen has become my absolute favorite skin care product of anything I own by far and I highly recommend it :)"," April 19, 2012"

4886,rosie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Caused me to break out in hives,"  I started using this product about a month ago while it was still winter.  It did not irritate my skin at first, but I have taken into consideration that it was still winter and the sun was not as strong and it was usually partly-cloudy where I live.  Now that it is spring and the sun is out more, I have been applying the product more, but it seems as soon as the sun hits my face and reacts with the sunscreen, I break out in hives.  It's really shocking because I normally have perfect skin and then I use the sunscreen and wake up the next morning with little red bumps all over my face that look like the chicken pox or something. Not cute at all!  I researched allergies to sunscreen and it turns out I have a photoallergy to the sunscreen, which is when there is a reaction between the chemicals in the sunscreen and the sunlight.  I'm really sad that this product has turned out to be a bust because at first I thought it was really great.  It seems to work for some people, but I have really sensitive skin so I would recommend for anyone else who has already clear but sensitive skin to not use this product."," March 23, 2012"
4887,RKat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Will help protect us from harmful rays,"  I LOVE this sunscreen. I take really good care of my skin, and I know that harsh sun rays can be extremely damaging. I dont muck around with low end brands that leave nasty residues all over my skin. This sunscreen is just so light on my skin, I love it. I use this in conjunction with my daily routine: "," June 17, 2014"
4888,Puppyhead5150,5.0 out of 5 stars,Animal friendly and works great,"  First off, the best thing about this product and the company EltaMD is that they are PETA approved which means they are 100% cruelty free. Amazingly this product is vegan as well.Besides being animal friendly, this sunscreen is awesome! It's consistency is light and it soaks into the skin. My skin is very prone to severe cystic acne and so far this has not broken me out. I am SO sick of companies thinking that if you are looking for an oil free non pore clogging product that they have to put salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in them which makes acne worse. Luckily EltaMD has made this perfect product not loaded with chemicals and skin drying crap! An added bonus is that the niacinamide in this product not only helps calm acne prone skin. but it helps with aging. This product is awesome for those of us that have adult acne and are looking for something that won't break us out, dry us out and will have anti-aging benefits.This is the best sunscreen as well as moisturizer that I have ever used! It's oil free, fragrance free and not tinted (thank goodness!)."," September 20, 2010"
4889,Kevin Westman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Protect Your Skin!,"  I love the sun and have been tanning for years. Tanning can take a toll on your face, so if you do tan your face, use a sunscreen like Eltamd UV Clear, it blocks the sun’s harmful rays and is light and clean on your face. Also, use a good moisturizer. I use Skingenixx Super Hydrating Moisturizer "," April 8, 2015"
4890,Becky G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. No issues!,"  After reading all the previous previews, I wanted to leave my experience. The packaging cake well sealed. I have purchased EltaMD products before from my dermatologist so I’m familiar with the packaging. My order came in and as you can see from the pictures it is well sealed. The batch number from the box is the same batch number in the bottle. Today is my first day using this specific product so I will come back and give an update on my review. I order the non-tinted version since I was worried about it being to thick and clogging my pours. I’m excited to use this. I have rosacea and hormonal acne."," December 5, 2019"
4891,reg214,1.0 out of 5 stars,Counterfeit EltaMD?,"  Either this bottle missed quality control or the it is counterfeit. Granted, I bought it last year (2016) as a backup, and it has been sitting and waiting its turn for a while. However, it isn't yet expired, and it was kept in a pretty cool, dark, and dry cabinet. Yet when I used the cream for the first time last week, both the smell and the color were off -- completely unlike the (many) other bottles of this product I have used. I guess I'll have to go back to the dermatologist to get the real stuff. Very disappointed."," July 28, 2017"
4892,Rowan Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Holy Grail SPF,"  I would have this product buried with me. I SWEAR by this and Elta Daily.I have dry skin that likes to peel if I’m not on my moisturizer game while living in the desert. On days I’m really dry I use UV Daily. On days when I have a pimple or feel my skin is congested, I use this UV Clear.If you’re trying to decide which you want, UV Daily is a MOISTURE BOMB. Not thick and gross, but definitely creamy.UV Clear moisturizes, but I find it soaks in and leaves a semi-matte finish. Sometimes I layer a different cream over it if I want the skin clearing benefits, but an added emollient.I recommend this HIGHLY to anyone who can’t find a sunscreen that doesn’t break them out. It never seems to leave a white cast (though I am quite pale) and it’s certainly never CAUSED a zit."," September 3, 2020"
4893,Polly Triviso,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get it! Excellent sunscreen!,"  Absolutely love it.I have melasma and every single morning after I brush my teeth I need to cover my face with sunscreen. This product is the only one (of the thousand different sunscreens I have tried) that actually doesn’t make my skin to break out, doesn’t give me oily look and I can see the protection (my sun spots are remaining the same)! I like the product so much that I ordered and the tinted version (which I didn’t like and don’t recommend), as well as the Face cleanser and eye cream. Well, Elta’s superstar is definitely this sunscreen. It’s my absolute favorite product so far and I don’t intend to switch or even try anything else in the foreseeable future!"," August 12, 2020"
4894,LifeIsGood,5.0 out of 5 stars,lovely,  Best feeling sunscreen I've tried in USA.  I know sunscreens made in Korea are light years ahead when it comes to applying and wearing comfort.  I don't have Korean sunscreens.  I live in FL and I needed good ones very badly for my family and myself.  A visiting relative told me about this one (she's a dermatologist).  I ordered and got it the same day.  This is it.  It's pricey BUT kids don't mind wearing it!  It goes on like a moisturizer.  It feels like a light moisturizer!  I love it.  I tend to break out.  I used generously couple times already and no breakout.  And sun protection works great- I tested while kayaking.  I highly recommend it.," June 2, 2021"
4895,Lisa,1.0 out of 5 stars,Burns and not fragrance free,  I can’t say how well this moisturizes since I only tried a dab of it on each cheek. First thing I noticed was the smell. I thought it was fragrance free. Second thing I noticed was it burns. It is very thin liquid with a subtle yellow tint. It does go on sheer if you only use a dab which is what I did however I don’t know how this can be for sensitive skin since it burns when applied but I have very sensitive skin and most things that work for other people don’t work for me. I have my best luck with Clinique and never any issues. I think this has to many chemicals for my sensitive skin and I need a physical sunscreen only. I’m not a fan of the smell either and this is the only one labeled fragrance free that actually has a scent that I’ve tried so far.," March 7, 2022"
4896,Jacqueline,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but pricy","  I like that this has niacinamide in it, which is great if you have oily skin, or anyone really! It does feel lightweight, and although there is a slight white cast at first (I’m medium skin toned) it goes away after a few minutes, and doesn’t leave a greasy feel/look. Also love that this is in a pump! Only down side is the price for how little this is, especially if you use every 2 hours. I happen to work outside quite a bit so I do. Lost 1 star because I wish it were a higher SPF. I’ll be looking for something more affordable."," July 1, 2020"
4897,Michelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Has been my #1 sunscreen for 5 years, don’t plan to stop","  As background, I have had severe acne for years and this sunscreen has done wonders. Even while I was taking Accutane, it was the perfect sunscreen. Since I’ve been off it, I’ve used tretinoin and it’s been equally if not more helpful. It helps combat redness and sensitivity and makes my skin feel sort of insulated, like a face oil on top of a moisturizer. It also helps heal recent flare-ups. I have less hyperpigmentation after a zit than I did before using this sunscreen. In terms of appearance, I have pink-tinted, fair to medium skin tone - not tan, not pale. It doesn’t leave any white cast, but it can increase shine a fair amount. So, if that’s not ideal, I might stay away. I personally don’t mind it and it’s more on the side of dewy than wet. I think it’s a magical sunscreen, the only downside is price in my opinion. I do choose to splurge on this, but it’s definitely not worth it for everyone."," October 26, 2021"
4898,Dylan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sheer Coverage with nice finish,"  This SPF is amazing!!! I have tried so many sunscreens and decided to try this after many positive reviews.  This one has everything I wanted. It is a mineral based small (pricey) pump bottle and it dispenses like a lotion, not watery. It blends in very well with a great finish and does not feel hot or make my face feel like it has a glove on. It is oil and fragrance free.**I read somewhere that this formula is NOT water resistant so FYI you will need another face sunscreen if you go swimming. It is also not completely chemical free and contains 7.5% octinoxate, a UVB filter. Overall I feel this is worth the money if you want a suncreen for your face and neck that works well and will not make your face feel hot."," May 19, 2021"
4899,INTJ_Unicorn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for sensitive skin,"  I have sensitive skin that’s prone to breakouts if anything new is applied and this product didn’t make my face break out. It’s light, nearly scent-free, and absorbs easily without residue. Works well under makeup."," June 25, 2019"
4900,Beth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I was looking for,"  I wanted a higher spf sunscreen to wear daily and under my makeup that wouldn’t leave a greasy feel or smell horrible. It was a tall order. This met all my requirements. It doesn’t have the sunscreen smell, is thin enough that it blends well, and doesn’t leave a greasy feel. I’ve mixed it with my day cream but also worn it alone and it’s been great both ways. I’m very pale so I can’t say if it will leave a white cast or not though. Highly recommend."," September 28, 2021"
4901,Fluffpuppypup,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on acne prone skin/skin with rosacea,"  Both my daughters and I love this sunscreen.  I have rosacea and they have typical acne prone teenage skin and this does not inflame or aggravate either condition.  Works really well too at preventing sunburns.  Goes on smoothly and does not leave a chalky whiteness that so many other zinc based formulas do.  Recommended by my dermatologist, I'm happy to have found this."," April 29, 2021"
4902,Marc,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Use it every day,  After doing a lot of research for sunscreen I came across this product about a year ago. Doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily and doesn’t run down your eyes when you’re working out. Even in the high elevations it protects your skin. I use it every day at work and when I’m doing Exercising or doing outdoor activities.," March 4, 2021"
4903,H,1.0 out of 5 stars,Comedogenic! Does NOT play well with makeup,  Terrible! I have never had so many blackheads and breakouts as I now have after just 3 uses of this product! Does NOT play well with makeup and I've tried servaral different product lines that do fine with other sunscreens. I could not get this to behave and hot just make a mess on my face. Gross. Just skip it and go for La-Roche Posay.," August 21, 2021"
4904,Malathy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with the product,"  I have Uber sensitive skin and I am afraid to try any new products. My friend's boyfriend suggested me this and upon reading the reviews, I got mixed reviews but thought of giving it a shot. I really loved the product and it set well with my skin. I did not experience any breakout and the SPF is really good for everyday use. I have seen considerable results and it has definitely helped with reducing tan. I would however recommend to do a patch test on face and see if the product really goes well with you."," July 1, 2021"
4905,Tiny T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best/ Great buy,"  Great buy. This was recommended by my African American dermatologist. Best for my oily skin. Goes on smooth, not oily at all. It even helps the dark spots. Feels good on my skin. Also last all day without getting oily."," September 18, 2020"
4906,Juli S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost feels like I'm wearing nothing,"  This sunscreen is great! I have kind of oily face and acne-prone skin, so I hate sunscreen lotions because they are greasy and sticky. Even the ones that advertise being non-greasy or ""invisible"" like Cetaphil and Neutrogena Ultra Sheer. This sunscreen is actually invisible and applies on the skin so smoothly. After application the skin absorbs it well and the face is matte. Even though Elta MD has a nice misty/matte finish, my skin still feels moisturized. I am glad I made the switch to Elta MD.The only thing is that the sunscreen is ""fragrance-free"" but I still smell a bit of a chemically odor, but that's because I have gotten used to wearing it daily."," December 30, 2019"
4907,Tash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive & acne prone skin,"  Found this sunscreen after months of research & I can confirm, with my sensitive & acne prone skin, this product gets the job done and no break outs! It’s glorious! There is less than a handful of sunscreens on the maker that do not break me out, this is one of them. Glad I found this, I’m on my second bottle."," March 30, 2020"
4908,Sherry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Silky smooth, no white cast.","  It's no wonder why dermatologists swear by this product! It's silky smooth, and does not leave a white cast. It feels like a very expensive moisturizer, and leaves your face well moisturized by sinking in and not sitting on top. This sunscreen is going to be my everything, morning and nigh-time moisturizer, it's that good. I'll put on all of my serums and layer this sunscreen on top. Best one I've tried, and I've tried them all. Even if your skin is oily, this works with no additional greasiness, just buy it."," February 18, 2021"
4909,H. Hickman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Doesn’t burn, gentle but works",  Does not burn...try to put it on atleast 15 minutes before going outside. And hopefully your face is mostly dry to dry when you apply.... it still seems to work very well if you are slightly sweaty but not drenched. No harsh smell to lotion and I have used this for many years and I don’t burn ...now that said...I’m in Florida and I do reapply if I’m out for a while and have been wiping the sweat from my face :)," July 8, 2019"
4910,Brittany ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sunscreen I've ever used,"  My far the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I have rosacea and had no issues with this causing more redness, burning, or stinging.  It didn't burn my eyes and I was able to apply it to my eyelid and under eye area.  It has no white cast and adsorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling on the skin.  The only downside is the price but I think it's a you pay for what you get situation."," January 7, 2021"
4911,Nekai Nekai,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Sunscreen for Melanated Skin!,"  I LOVE this sunscreen. I have normal/oily, melanated, acne prone skin and not once has this broken me out. I love how lightweight it is. Ifykyk oily skin and anything heavy is a no-go, so the fact that this sunscreen seamlessly just blends into my skin without evaporating or being too heavy is god-sent. When the formula says clear, baby they mean it! It doesn’t cast a white film-like layer on my ski, so no more pale dead zombie face for me! The packaging is also easy to use, the pump hasn’t gotten jammed even though I use 2-3x a day. Drop the pennies and just buy it!"," September 13, 2021"
4912,Gabi,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best SPF,"  I love Elta MD sunscreen and use it literally every day- it's so great and doesn't leave a white cast or burn my eyes. It works well on it's own or under makeup.I was nervous to order from Amazon because some users mentioned their sunscreen didn't come with a LOT number. Mine did and is 100% legit, I would make sure you are ordering from Amazon and not an unverified seller. I now have this product on subscription!"," August 11, 2021"
4913,Darling,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best sunscreen,"  THIS is the face sunscreen we all should be using, look it up online, it’s the most recommended for dermatologist and they don’t lie, I just got my 4rth one today and I don’t feel like ever changing it, even my friends turned to it after they saw how my skin improved. It’s helped me with acne and evening out my skin. I love it"," June 3, 2020"
4914,EAS,5.0 out of 5 stars,The SPF I use,  I use this year round. I apply 3 layers in the AM and reapply every 2-3 hours. I have never had a burn or have any sun damage or Melasma or anything. I'm 40 years old and on Tretinoin.," August 17, 2019"
4915,Samantha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"  I have sensitive skin, and asked my dermatologist what brand of sunscreen I should use.  She recommended this and I tried it.  Two years later, I still love it!  I use a heavier version in the winter and a lighter version in the summer -- both are light, not greasy, odorless, and work!  Love it!"," November 5, 2019"
4916,Taggart,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Gentle on skin, effective protection","  Great non greasy formula that goes on smoothly, protects well, and doesn’t cause skin irritation or breakouts. It also doesn’t have that whitish look that you get with wearing other sunscreen. It’s light enough to wear under make up if desired. I always use this for my face. It’s a really quality product."," September 13, 2021"
4917,Stella Meister,4.0 out of 5 stars,great sunscreen for acne prone/sensitive skin,"  great sunscreen for sensitive skin, doesn’t burn at all. I do notice a bit of a white cast so maybe not best for darker skin. haven’t broken out at all. I don’t normally burn so i don’t know how effective the sun protection element is, but feels fine. no odor either. great sunscreen! I haven’t noticed the ‘’matte finish” that they advertise tho. my face doesn’t look oily at the end of the day per se, but definitely not matte:)"," July 3, 2020"
4918,GF,3.0 out of 5 stars,My faces looks really oily,"  I got this product for the first time 3 weeks ago and I started to use it right away. At first I was using my normal mosturizer + sunscreen, but I realize my face look too oily. I stop using my mosturizer during the day because Im only applying the ELTA sunscreen but my face still looks really oily. I already have acne problems, it doesn't seems like it clogged my pores but I have a shinny face with this product."," October 8, 2020"
4919,Sydney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Obsessed with this sunscreen,"  This is my hands down go to sunscreen for every day wear now. I've tried a few others, but this is favorite. It does smell slightly sunscreeny at first, but that doesn't bother me. It feels like on my skin and does not make me feel oily or like I have a lot of product on my face. I'll be using this for a while."," January 7, 2021"
4920,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,"  I have used this sunscreen for several years after buying it at my dermatologists office. I love it. She also recommended neutrogena and I used it but it was too greasy. I have oily, acne prone skin and this is very lightweight and provides good sun protection without clogging my pores or feeling greasy."," June 7, 2020"
4921,Promita Swamy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and no white sheen,  I’m very picky about sunscreen but this is one the best ones I have used so far. It has zinc oxide which is necessary for the UV rays bounce back and also it’s very lightweight so it doesn’t feel heavy on the face. It spreads nicely and doesn’t have a white sheen. I’m very happy with this sunscreen.," April 28, 2021"
4922,A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for,"  My mom’s derm recommended it and I decided to give it a try. It’s moisturizing, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly.

4923,Michelle,2.0 out of 5 stars,The sunscreen pills!,  I heard great reviews about the elta sunscreen but it pills VERY easily and lifts any makeup you want to put over it! It is basically unable to be layered with makeup and even wearing alone leads to pilling. :(," March 6, 2021"
4924,Erin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Changed my sunscreen game!,"  I’ve never been one to apply sunscreen everyday and that’s mainly attributed to the fact that I haven’t found one I enjoy using. This product changed the game for me! It blends into the skin nicely and also offers other skincare benefits. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I have very dry skin and I find that it could be a bit more moisturizing. Otherwise, I will definitely continue to repurchase!"," January 2, 2021"
4925,DPR,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing amazing amazing!!!,"  I was told that this product will help me not break out like other Sun screens.

My dermatologist recommended this sun screen and I am so happy I pulled the trigger!  I use medicated face wash twice a day and nighttime / daytime serums and am always concerned how products will react with the chemicals.

4943,Yan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for sensitive and acne skin,"  Really friendly to the oil skin and acne, and can be removed by normal facial cleaner, such as Cereave. My skin doctor recommended this for me. Also, it would seem a little bit oil, but it’s okay for me."," January 5, 2021"
